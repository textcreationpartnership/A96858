            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here are three bookes wherein the <hi>Deity</hi> may be plainly read and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, the booke of nature, the book of the creatures, and the book of the Scriptures: this latter was pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the Jewes, the two former com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon both to Jew and Gentile; <hi>for unto the Jewes were committed the oracles of</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:116028:7"/> 
               <hi>God,</hi> becauſe they were his peculiar people, unto the Jew and Gentile the light of nature, and uſe of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, becauſe they both were men, and inhabitants of the world. Now out of theſe three bookes our Apoſtle labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to convince of unrighteouſneſſe the two great enemies of our juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by faith in Chriſt, the ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited Jew, and the Idolatrous Gentile: for however the one might pretend unto ſalvation by vertue of their inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent righteouſneſſe, and the other hope to eſcape damnation by their ignorance of the Law, which threatneth death to the breakers thereof, yet our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle in this his Epiſtle doth plainly demonſtrate, that neither the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the one was ſo commenſurate and anſwerable to the law of God, as to attaine heaven and avoid the curſe, and that the ignorance of the other was not ſo great, as that thereby they might become inexcuſable, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offence towards God; both Jew and Gentile are ſinfull, <hi>for there is none that doth good, no not one,</hi> and therefore
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:116028:7"/> both Jew and Gentile are lyable unto damnation; the Jewes, becauſe it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for them to keepe the Law, from the obſervance of which they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected life; the Gentile, becauſe they were not obedient unto thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon notions, and implanted truths they had of God and morall honeſty. For however they pretended not to know God, and therefore not to hold the truth in unrighteouſneſſe, as 'tis evidently ſhewne they doe in the fore-going verſe; yet our Apoſtle doth by force of Argument take away their falſe pretences, and plainly convinceth them of both in the words of my Text, which, as I ſuppoſe, are brought in to prevent a ſecret objectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile might frame againſt the doctrine of the precedent verſe: for the Apoſtle being about to prove our juſtification onely by faith, doth in the 18. verſe diſpute negatively, &amp; ſhew that workes, in which both Jew and Gentile truſted, could never juſtifie, they being ſo farre from making us appeare righteous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, that the wrath of God is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:116028:8"/> revealed againſt them, for the wrath of God is revealed from heaven againſt all ungodlineſſe and unrighteouſneſſe of men. The beſt workes of naturall men cannot free them from being guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ungodlineſſe and unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, from the breach of the firſt and ſecond Tables, and therefore is the wrath of God revealed from heaven, even againſt the beſt workes of men. But what kind of men are theſe that ſtand thus charged with ungodlineſſe and unrighteouſneſſe? Why? <hi>Such,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Paul, who hold the truth in unrighteouſneſſe;</hi> but you Gentiles doe thus hold the truth in unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, 'tis you that ſuppreſſe, ſmother, and impriſon thoſe truthes that are in you concerning God and your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and therefore 'tis you primarily, who ſtand guilty of unrighteouſneſſe and ungodlineſſe: and here you may ſuppoſe the froward Gentile mutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within himſelfe, and thus cavilling at the Apoſtles <hi>minor,</hi> what Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> will you ſay, we hold the truth in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſſe? whereas we are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:116028:8"/> ignorant of God: the Jewes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are without excuſe, becauſe in the Scriptures God is plainly revealed unto them; but as for us we ſit in darkneſſe, and the ſhadow of death, without the leaſt glimmering or knowledge of God, and therefore pray forbeare ſo hard a cenſure: no, ſaith the Apoſtle, ſay what you will, yet there is a light within you, and there are creatures without you, that will eaſily confute your fond opinion; it is not for Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles to plead ignorance, becauſe that which may be knowne of God is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in them, <hi>for the inviſible things of him, &amp;c.</hi> So then you may have here the Gentiles plea refuted; they ſecretly ſeem to plead not guilty to the Apoſtles charge of their with-holding the truth in unrighteouſneſſe: their plea ſeemes to be taken from their ignorance of God, and could they have maintained this, they might eaſily have eluded that; wherefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to take away all ſhifts and evaſions from them, and the better to confirme his charge, brings in two bills of reply againſt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:116028:9"/> them, the firſt is grounded upon that naturall light which God hath mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted unto them concerning himſelfe; the ſecond upon the creatures, which with a dumbe kind of eloquence did every where proclaime the power of their Maker, and which were as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and guidance unto them into the knowledge of the Godhead, which they vainly pretended to be ignorant of. To the firſt of theſe grounds I ſhall ſpeake at preſent, and onely more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtincly handle what I have heretofore in a private Congregation repreſented in groſſe.</p>
            <p>Take the words as they lye in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and you ſhall find in them <hi>ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid allegatum, &amp; aliquid probatum,</hi> an allegation, and a proofe or reaſon of this allegation. The Gentile ſeems to plead ignorance; the Apoſtle alleageth the contrary, becauſe, ſaith he, that which may be knowne of God is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in them: and leſt he ſhould ſeem to ſtick here, he brings in further evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and proofe, for what he had ſaid in theſe words, <hi>for God hath ſhewne it unto them.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:116028:9"/>
            <p> In both you may be pleaſed to take notice of, Firſt, the matter alleaged, their knowledge of God, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that which may be knowne of God, or that which is knowable of God, namely, by natures diſcovery, not by extraordinary revelations, and Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall diſpenſations, as <hi>Vorſtius</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers without reaſon conceive. For this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in the preceding verſe, which according unto <hi>Beza,</hi> and the beſt expoſitors is nothing but a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall knowledge of God, and of good and evill; the knowledge of God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily Implying, or at leaſt upon inevitable conſequence bringing in the knowledge of good and evill.</p>
            <p>2. Secondly, you may obſerve the qualification or manner of this their knowledge, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, it <hi>is manifeſt</hi> as the light which ſhineth in them, and is ſo cleare, that do what they can, they can never ſhut their eyes againſt it, or wholly blot it out.</p>
            <p>3. Thirdly, here are the ſubjects in whom this knowledge reſides, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>in them (viz.)</hi> in the Gentiles, which ſome tranſlate, amongſt them, and ſo
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:116028:10"/> referre this knowledge to their learned ones, and <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> who have left every where in their writings evident teſtimonies thereof; but our owne tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation, as I conceive, is moſt proper &amp; neerer the originall, and ſo in them will be as much as in their minds and conſciences, as you will further heare anon.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, here is the <hi>Author</hi> of this knowledge in them, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, God, uſhered in with the rational particle <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, for God hath ſhewne it unto them, God, that is, partly by the light of nature in their conſciences, and partly by the conduct of the creatures, hath ſo plainly declared and ſhewed himſelfe unto the Gentiles, that they cannot pretend their ignorance of him, or of their duty towards their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
            <p>From the words thus opened you may gather this Obſervation, <hi>That there is, &amp; ever hath been in all men, even in the Gentiles, a Naturall light, whereby they have been directed unto God, and naturall goodneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="9" facs="tcp:116028:10"/>
            <p> In the proſecution of which I ſhall ſhew you, Firſt, what is meant more fully by this Naturall light.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I ſhall indeavour to demonſtrate that it is and ever hath bin in all men, even in the Gentiles.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I ſhall enquire; whether or no, this naturall light were ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent unto the ſalvation of the Gentiles.</p>
            <p>And Laſtly, I ſhall deduce ſome practicall inferences, from what ſhall be ſaid for our owne uſe. For the underſtanding of the firſt point, namely what is meant, by this Naturall light, or light of nature, we muſt note that man may be conſidered, either in his primitive creation, or in his corrupted ſinfull eſtate; if we conſider, man firſt in his created integrity: ſo without doubt this light was a clear, diſtinct, penetrative and unerring light: for God framing all things according to that exact plat-forme and Idea, which was eternally in himſelfe, did accordingly beſtow upon his creatures all things requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite unto their ſeverall ſpecies and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:116028:11"/> conditions, and therefore man being the Maſter-peece, (as I may ſo ſpeake) of all his works, was by him primitively Inveſted with more noble endowments then any other creature whatſoever: for whereas other things were either by inſtinct or immediate direction of God ordered unto their ſeverall ends and his glory, man alone amongſt the reſt did cleerely and rationally appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the will and greatneſſe of his maker; other creatures did blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſerve him in their ſeverall Ranckes and orders, but man being farther enlightned with an underſtanding and reaſonable ſoule, did freely, and with choice cleave unto him as his cheifeſt good, ſo that Adam by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that excellent light which God had infuſed unto him, did know God, and his will ſavingly, and with ſuch a perfection as was moſt proper for his condition. For though it may bee true what the School-men ſay, that this concreated light and knowledge in our firſt parents might have been further increaſed by rationall diſcourſe, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:116028:11"/> ſupervenient grace, yet doubtleſſe in it ſelfe, without any further addition it was ſufficient to lead them into a ſaving knowledge of the will and true worſhip of God; theſe divine rayes ſoe enlightning the whole man, that the great Myſteries of God and ſalvation were as diſtinctly impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon his ſoule, as the Image of the Sunne ever was upon the moſt pure and Cryſtalline glaſſe.</p>
            <p>But now, Secondly, as the moſt beautifull picture, being ſullyed and dawbed over, doth looſe much of its forme and grace, ſoe likewiſe that excellent image of God in man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once beſmeared over with ſinne, did looſe very much of its priſtine glory and goodneſſe, and therefore no wonder if the ſame light and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God in man, which before was ſo cleere and diſtinct in us, is now through ſin become dull, confuſed, and faint; for it is the nature of ſin alwaies to overcaſt and unite the ſoule with ignorance, as you may every where read in the Scriptures of the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:116028:12"/> blindneſſe, darkneſſe, and ignorance of men in the ſtate of Nature. Sinne then interpoſing betweene God and us, this glorious light ſuffered a very fearefull Eclips, and as the faint glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merings of a Lamp or Candle in the ſocket, was mingled with very much darkneſſe and confuſion: for though through ſin it was not quite extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in us, as plainely appeares by the text, yet ſo far was it dulled that we cannot by the remainders thereof either read the will of God, or from it derive any comfort unto our ſelves. For as by a dull and obſcure taper we may perhaps view a body in groſſe, whereas we cannot through the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the light ſcan each particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar part of it; why ſo here, by this light of nature we may apprehend indeed God &amp; his worſhip in generall, but we can never thereby dive more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly into his will, or thoſe his attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of grace, pardoning mercy, love unto us in Chriſt, and the like, which none can fully underſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d without faith in Chriſt <hi>in whom alone are hid all the</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:116028:12"/> 
               <hi>treaſures of wiſdome and knowledge, Col.</hi> 2. <hi>verſ.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>Wel then, to draw to an head, by comparing theſe our two eſtates toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, you may eaſily conceive what is meant by this naturall light, or light of nature; for it is nothing elſe but thoſe common ordinary notions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits remaining in the minds and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of men concerning God and naturall goodneſſe: in the firſt verſe it is called the truth, becauſe of thoſe plaine convictions it hath upon the conſciences of naturall men, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they that reſiſt this light, and walk not according unto its dictates are ſaid to hold the truth in unrighteouſneſſe, that is, unjuſtly to ſtifle and keep un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe apprehenſions of God and goodneſſe, from appearing in their Lives or Actions. And in the ſecond of this Epiſtle, and the thirteenth, it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the Law written in their hearts,</hi> from the command &amp; awfull power it hath over the hearts of men, in which it is engraven as with the point of a dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond; and therefore <hi>Iamblicus</hi> an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:116028:13"/> Author calls it an inbred and immoveable notion. Wee ſtile this light of nature, common, ordinary no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and conceipts; common they are, becauſe they are congeniall, and imbred in all men; and ordinary, becauſe, though all men naturally have ſome ſlight and catching conceipts at God, yet they neither know aright who or what kind of God this is, and therefore you may read <hi>Act.</hi> 17. <hi>verſ.</hi> 23. of an Altar amongſt the <hi>Athenians</hi> inſcribed, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the unknowne God:</hi> and Chriſt ſaid the <hi>Samaritans</hi> worſhipped they knew not what, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 22. Secondly, we ſay that theſe notions remaine in the minds and conſciences of men; for firſt, in the minds reſide thoſe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, thoſe ſpeculative, prime and fundamentall truths, namely, that there is a God, that all effects have depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon ſome cauſe, and the like. And ſecondly, becauſe in the conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of men reſide thoſe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, thoſe practicall and morall principles, by which we conclude within our ſelves, that ſince there is a God, he is
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:116028:13"/> to be worſhipped, that we ought to do unto others as we would have them doe unto us, that we ought to deale juſtly with all men, and the like. From whence it is that the Apoſtle ſaith of the <hi>Gentiles, that they do by nature the things contained in the Law, even the Gentiles have a naturall Law imprinted in their hearts,</hi> by which they are carried unto thoſe Common generall duties which concerne God and their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; which will further be cleered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you if you conſider with me the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond point, namely, that this light of nature is in all men; or rather thus, that there are ſome Common notions of God and goodneſſe imprinted in the hearts of all men, even of the Gentiles. There is no man ſo over dawbed with ſin and filthyneſſe, ſo benigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and overclouded with wretched ignorance, but hath oftentimes the flaſhes and immediate repreſentations of the Deity darting in upon him, and there is noe man of ſoe debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and looſe a life, ſo benummed and frozen affections, but hath ever
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:116028:14"/> and anon the ſecret whips and girds of a conſcience to reſtraine him, together alſo with naturall Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of goodneſſe to thaw and melt him into more ingenuity; Now then that this light of nature,</p>
            <p>Firſt, as it relates unto God, is in all, may appeare both by ſcripture and by reaſon; as for ſcripture were there no other, my text would be ſufficient proof that that which may be known of God is manifeſt in them, that is in the Gentiles, and ſo conſequently in all. <hi>That which may be knowne of God,</hi> whereby is implyed, that there are ſome things concerning God above the pitch and kenne of this naturall light, the myſteries indeed of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, of the Incarnation of Chriſt and the like are Riddles unto nature, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they ever be reacht unto by humane diſquiſition; Yet it ſtill remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth certaine that that which may be knowne of God, namely his being, his omnipotence and the like is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in them. In the 17. of the <hi>Acts verſ.</hi> 26, 27, 28. you may have another
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:116028:14"/> proofe for the Apoſtle there in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon unto the <hi>Athenian</hi> Heathens, ſhewing that God was not ſo far from them, but that he might even <hi>Palpando inveniri,</hi> as <hi>Beza</hi> tranſlates it, be <hi>groped after,</hi> and <hi>eaſily found out.</hi> By that little <hi>naturall light</hi> that was in them they might tracke the foot-ſteps of <hi>Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and haply find out <hi>in whom they lived, moved, and had their being:</hi> And ſo in the <hi>Acts, chap.</hi> 14. <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. 'tis ſaid that God <hi>left not himſelfe without wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> There is within us an <hi>inbred light,</hi> as a domeſticke Chaplaine continually to teach us, and without us rain from heaven, and fruitfull ſeaſons, as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny viſible <hi>witneſſes</hi> to take away igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and all excuſe from us; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that of the <hi>Pſalmiſt, The foole hath ſaid in his heart, Pſal.</hi> 14. 1. muſt not be underſtood as if a wicked man (for he is the <hi>foole</hi> here) could quite obliterate and put out the light of nature, and Knowledge of God in him (for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſme</hi> can never find a perfect and continuall aſſent in the heart of man) but onely that he ſo workes and lives
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:116028:15"/> without the <hi>feare</hi> of God, as if he were fully perſwaded that there were no God at all. The reaſons then to prove that the Knowledge of God is in all men <hi>Naturally,</hi> may be many, I ſhall name only two or three, and let paſſe the <hi>common conſent</hi> of all <hi>Nations. Nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la gens tam barbara eſt,</hi> ſaith <hi>Tully,</hi> there is no nation ſo barbarous and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of <hi>Common reaſon,</hi> as not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a God; to let paſſe alſo the Naturall diſcourſes, and ultimate reſolutions of the minds of men into ſome <hi>Supreame cauſe,</hi> and <hi>firſt Mover</hi> of all things.</p>
            <p>1. Firſt, the teſtimonies of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens themſelves do ſufficiently evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the truth; 'tis <hi>Pauls</hi> way of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing with the <hi>Athenians, as certaine alſo of your owne Poets have ſaid, we are alſo his Ofspring, Acts</hi> 17. 28. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers their knowledge of God, and the truth of his worſhip from their owne mouthes, and ſo may we alſo. <hi>Plato</hi> calls a man <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a creature naturally religious, and a worſhiper of God: yea himſelfe hath written ſo Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:116028:15"/> and Reverently of God, that many of the Antients have gone about to prove him a Chriſtian; though <hi>Bernard</hi> truly and wittily ſaith, <hi>whilſt many would faine make Plato a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian they prove themſelves heathens.</hi> It would be as endleſſe as it is needleſſe to produce here the ſeverall teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies which <hi>Heathen Authors</hi> do every where give to this truth, ſome amongſt them ſealing it with their blood, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers every where profeſſing it in their writings: and however there have been ſome few amongſt them, who have denyed this truth, yet I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded their <hi>tongues</hi> went not along with their <hi>hearts.</hi> Twas more their deſire that there ſhould be no God, then their opinion that there was none. As guilty priſoners wiſh the death of their <hi>Judge,</hi> onely becauſe they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him to be the inſtrument of their condemnation: in like manner theſe and ſuch like men being conſcious to themſelves, of their owne deſperate wickedneſſe deſire the not being of him whoſe <hi>Juſtice</hi> they well know
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:116028:16"/> muſt needes take notice of and ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puniſh their offences.</p>
            <p>For, ſecondly, the Teſtimonies of their <hi>Conſciences</hi> will eaſily declare that they have ſuch a <hi>light</hi> and <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of God within them. There is no man ſo great, ſo abſolute and independent from the command and beck of others, but is ſometimes awed and controled by a <hi>Power</hi> within his owne breſt, and thoſe ſecret checks and laſhes of <hi>Conſcience</hi> upon the commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſion of ſome notorious offence, muſt needes make the ſtouteſt ſinner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe a power above him, which he feares, and a God unto whom he is accountable for all his Offences. Hence the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſhewing the <hi>workes of the Law</hi> to be <hi>written in the Hearts</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> amplifies it further, and addes this as a kind of a reaſon, <hi>their conſciences alſo bearing them wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and their thoughts in the meane while accuſing or elſe excuſing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Rom.</hi> 2. <hi>verſ.</hi> 15.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the very multiplicity of the <hi>Heatheniſh Gods</hi> may (as I ſuppoſe)
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:116028:16"/> plainly ſhew that they had this inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible principle written in their hearts; for though ſome of them had as many Gods as they had <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyons</hi> and <hi>Leekes</hi> in their gardens; and though the Worſhip they aſcribed unto theſe their Deities was as various as the ſeverall nations and opinions of men were; yet theſe their various Worſhips and Opinions of a God did plainely denote, that a God it was whom they ſought and hunted after; for though they erred in <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,</hi> yet they all agreed in this <hi>Generall,</hi> that a God there was. As the water of the ſame fountaine may bee diverſely ſpread into ſeverall ſtreames and eddyes, yet all theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall ſtreames &amp; eddyes fall into one ſea; ſo likewiſe though this principle of nature may flow and be divided into various opinions concerning God, yet theſe various opinions doe all meete and concenter in this Generall notion and conceite of a God. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith that the <hi>Athenians</hi> did generally worſhip the true God
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:116028:17"/> under the falſe maske and Inſcription they gave unto him of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nknowne God,</hi> as you may ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 17. <hi>verſ.</hi> 23.</p>
            <p>But, ſecondly, this <hi>Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> as it relates unto <hi>Naturall good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> is in all men; <hi>Naturall goodneſſe</hi> I ſay, for as for that <hi>legall goodneſſe</hi> which ſuppoſeth, the righteouſneſſe of worke, tis impoſſible for any ſonne of Adam to have, <hi>for by the deeds of the Law there ſhall be no fleſh juſtified in his ſight, Rom.</hi> 3. 20. And as for that Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall goodneſſe which ſuppoſeth the righteouſneſſe of faith, no unbeliever can pertake of it, <hi>for faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God. Rom.</hi> 10. 17.</p>
            <p>It remaines then that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> onely had and ſtill have the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Naturall goodneſſe</hi> alone left in them; now that they had this will bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter appeare by diſtinguiſhing of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall goodneſſe,</hi> which is either civill or morrall; civill goodneſſe I ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine to be <hi>that inbred propenſion in all men to maintaine ſocieties and naturall life.</hi> This certainly was, and at this
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:116028:17"/> day is in the <hi>Heathens</hi> themſelves: from whence elſe have proceeded thoſe excellent poſitive Lawes and Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of <hi>Solon, Draco</hi> and others, by which as by ſo many ſinewes and ligaments, Common-wealths hath bin joyned and compacted together? From whence thoſe noble inventions and ſciences of <hi>Phyſick, Mathematick, Aſtronomy</hi> and the like, without which mans life would be neither comfortable not delightfull? From whence thoſe inferiour <hi>Mechanicall</hi> arts, by which rude and undigeſted things are curiouſly modified and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the uſe of man? From whence are theſe, I ſay, and many of the like nature, but from that inbred Naturall Life of Goodneſſe in man, guiding and directing him unto the common Publique good of humane ſociety? Hence we read of <hi>Jaball and Juball and Tuball-Cain Gen.</hi> 4. cunning artificers and curious inventors, which yet notwithſtanding were all meer <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall men</hi> of the curſed race, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Covenant &amp; Church of God.</p>
            <pb n="24" facs="tcp:116028:18"/>
            <p> The ſecond ſort of <hi>naturall goodneſſe</hi> may be called morall, &amp; it conſiſts (as I conceive) in a mans <hi>obedience unto the dictates of reaſon, in embracing vertue &amp; voiding vice.</hi> That the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were thus morally good, thoſe admirable exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of their <hi>Juſtice, Fortitude, Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> and other the like vertues, do ſufficiently declare. Some of them being ſo exactly rigorous in adminiſtring of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> that they have not ſpared their owne ſons offending: ſome againe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voting themſelves, and expoſing their owne throats to the ſword for the good of their country: Others ſo <hi>Abſtemious</hi> and <hi>Temperate,</hi> that in the greateſt feaſts of their <hi>Princes,</hi> they have not ſo much as touched any wine: Others ſo <hi>Chaſt,</hi> that they have not admitted into their ſight any object that might provoke them unto luſt. It were eaſie here to make a particular induction through all the Commandements of the ſecond Table, and prove unto you as aſwell by inſtances of Scripture, as from prophane authors, how that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> by their exact outward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:116028:18"/> unto reaſon, evidently ſhewed the worke of the Law to be written in their hearts. But examples of this kind are infinite; and not onely examples, but precepts alſo; for what excellent rules do they every where preſcribe for the ſteering and directing a man in the paths of Vertue? What grave and ſage precepts, eſchewing of evill, embracing of good? We muſt indeed confeſſe, that theſe grave precepts, theſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent rules, however in generall knowne and preſcribed, were yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, when they came particularly to be applyed, oftentimes little uſed or made good by the practiſe of their <hi>owne Authors:</hi> ſuch was that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling power of <hi>Paſſion</hi> in the ſtricteſt Profeſſors, that ſome of them have lived in the common practice of thoſe vices which their judgements other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have diſallowed; as we may read concerning <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> then whom no one hath more commended <hi>chaſtity;</hi> and yet ſo little did he obſerve his own rules, that he would faine make a <hi>Goddeſſe</hi> of his impure ſtrumpet, and ſo
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:116028:19"/> 
               <hi>Canonize</hi> his owne luſts. Who writ more divinely concerning the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the world then <hi>Seneca?</hi> and yet who a greater worldling? who more covetous then himſelfe? as both <hi>Tacitus</hi> and <hi>Suetonius</hi> note of him. Who ſeemed better furniſhed with Morall principles then <hi>Zeno</hi> and <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes?</hi> and yet even they ſo little obeyed them, that they relapſed into unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall luſts, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Laërtius</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve of them, and as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> of other <hi>Gentiles</hi> in the latter end of this <hi>Chapter.</hi> Wherefore it will not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe, now in the third place, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, whether or no this <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> be ſufficient unto <hi>ſalvation:</hi> or, whether one may be ſaved by this <hi>light of nature</hi> without ſaith in <hi>Chriſt?</hi> This ſaith our <hi>Mountacute,</hi> in the firſt of his <hi>Eccleſiaſticall Apparatus,</hi> is the opinion of many of the Fathers, <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Alexandrinus, Juſtin Martyr, Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and others whom he there reckoneth up: how ever this ſame Author ſhowes the contrary opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of moſt of the reſt; and ſure I am
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:116028:19"/> that <hi>Auſtin</hi> in many of his bookes <hi>de Civitate Dei,</hi> is againſt them, and ſo are moſt of the <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> the Modern eſpecially, together with moſt of the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Doctors and <hi>Proteſtant</hi> refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers. But to omit the citation of their words, which you may elſwhere find, that I may according to the judgment and ſenſe of the beſt divines briefly and clearly ſtate the point, I ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe theſe foure things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the ignorance of Chriſt cannot in it ſelfe excuſe a man, and free him from damnation. There is a twofold ignorance you know, either <hi>juris,</hi> when a man is ignorant of what he is bound to know; or <hi>facti,</hi> when he is onely ignorant of ſome particular circumſtance of what is done: this latter may excuſe, as appeares in the caſe of <hi>Abimelech: Gen.</hi> 20. 6. the former doth not; and therefore God having revealed his will in the Scriptures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning himſelfe and Chriſt, every man upon forfeiture of his ſalvation, was and is bound to know it. As if a Prince ſhould publiſh a Proclamation
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:116028:20"/> out of a man's hearing, and in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, 'tis not his abſence, or the not hearing thereof that can exempt him from puniſhment, if he diſobeyes it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, that there are, &amp; ever have beene moſt of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtitute of any knowledge of Chriſt; and that whether it be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit, diſtinct, particular knowledge of <hi>him,</hi> and his <hi>offices,</hi> or an implicit onely and generall, concerning the <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>ſubſiſtence</hi> of ſuch a Saviour: and therefore the incarnation of Chriſt is called <hi>an hidden myſtery to former ages. Col.</hi> 1. <hi>verſ.</hi> 26. and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calls thoſe times before Chriſt, <hi>the times of ignorance, Act.</hi> 17. 30.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, that the knowledge of Chriſt, and faith in him, is every way <hi>neceſſary</hi> unto ſalvation; <hi>neceſſary</hi> as the onely meanes for the obtaining of it, for <hi>there is no other name given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heaven, whereby we muſt be ſaved, Act</hi> 4. 2. and <hi>neceſſary</hi> by vertue of the injunction and poſitive command of God, for <hi>this is his Commandement, that we ſhould believe on the name of</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:116028:20"/> 
               <hi>his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 23.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, that God may inſtill oftentimes this faith into the hearts of many by meanes altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne unto us, and therefore that we ought not altogether to deſpaire of the ſalvation of ſuch <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who have endeavoured in their life time to follow the lights and dictates of right reaſon. I ſpeake not this, as if God were bound to beſtow faith or ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon ſuch men, but onely to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the <hi>unſearchable riches</hi> of his <hi>Mercy.</hi> And to gaine a more charitable conſtruction upon our following con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, theſe things then being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, we aſſert the negative part of the queſtion, and ground this conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, namely, <hi>that no Gentile living and dying without faith in Chriſt can be ſaved by walking according to the light of nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The truth of this may, firſt, appeare by conſidering the imperfection and worthleſneſſe of their beſt naturall workes and vertues. We do not deny all manner of reward or profit unto
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:116028:21"/> ſuch <hi>Gentiles</hi> who lived more vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly then others; for beſides the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent tranquility of Conſcience they enjoyed in this world, like enough their torments may be more tolerable in the next: but this wee may ſafely ſay, that the ſtricteſt of them either in life or profeſſion could never ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the law, and ſo conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly never attaine unto ſalvation. For there never hath been any more then two wayes unto heaven, either by the <hi>Law,</hi> or by the <hi>Goſpell;</hi> but as for the <hi>Law,</hi> it was impoſſible for them to fulfill it, and as for the <hi>Goſpell,</hi> t'is ſuppoſed in the queſtion that they never believed it. I know very well, that there have been many who have gon about to <hi>Canonize</hi> the <hi>Gentiles</hi> for their excellent vertues; amongſt whom is <hi>Zuinglius</hi> of latter dayes, and ſome of the <hi>Fathers</hi> of old: but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly had they weighed even their beſt Actions in the balance of the Sanctuary, they had found them ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then vanity it ſelfe. There are two things (as I conceive) mainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:116028:21"/> in every action, the principle from whence it proceedes, and the end unto which it is directed; now both theſe in the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were carnall, and not the leaſt way acceptable to God: for as for the Principle and fountaine of their actions t'was fleſh, <hi>but fleſh and bloud can never inherit the Kingdome of heaven,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor,</hi> 15. 50. <hi>And that which is borne of the fleſh is fleſh, John</hi> 3. 6. And as for the end of their Actions, t'was uſually ambition and hope of praiſe, or covetouſneſſe and hope of reward. And this was the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Phariſees, and yet our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſaith <hi>except our righteouſneſſe exceed the righteouſneſſe of the Scribes and Phariſees, we ſhall in no wiſe enter into the Kingdome of Heaven, Mat:</hi> 5. 20. Tis the end that makes the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Good or Bad. Almeſgiving <hi>Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially</hi> and in it ſelfe conſidered is a good act, but then being performed by a Phariſee, for a bad end, it became evill: and ſo likewiſe the Vertuous Actions of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> may according to their outward matter be Morally
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:116028:22"/> good, when as if we conſider either the Principle from whence they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, or the End unto which they were directed, they were but at the beſt <hi>Splendida peccata,</hi> handſome and well dreſt ſinnes, and therefore nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>ex congruo,</hi> as ſome of the <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> and <hi>Papiſts</hi> hold, leading unto further Grace, nor at all Acceptable in the eyes of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this may further appeare by conſidering the neceſſity of Faith unto ſalvation. For if it be true, <hi>that without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God, Heb.</hi> 11. 6. and if it be true alſo, <hi>that this onely is life eternall to know God and Jeſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent, Joh.</hi> 17. 3. Then doubtleſſe are thoſe in a very ſad condition who never ſo much as heard of this <hi>Author of Salvation,</hi> this <hi>Chriſt,</hi> in whom only God is well pleaſed. And however ſome men urge, that there is no ſuch neceſſity for the <hi>Gentiles</hi> believing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was impoſſible for them thus to believe, having had heretofore no incomes or way to come to the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:116028:22"/> knowledge of him; we anſwere.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that abſolutely there is no ſuch <hi>impoſſibility;</hi> for then how came <hi>Job</hi> and others <hi>Gentiles</hi> into the pale of the Church: and according to ſome, the Law of Nature was ſufficient to diſcover unto them a Chriſt; though this ſavours too much of <hi>Pelagianiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe, ſecondly, what though it was impoſſible for them barely by the light of nature to believe? yet ſhall we tax God of tying his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to <hi>impoſſibilities?</hi> certainly we cannot; for it was not Gods fault but mans, who by his ſinfull fall contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted unto himſelfe and his poſterity ſuch an <hi>impoſſibility.</hi> But I muſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, this may further be made good unto you, by conſidering the vaſt diſproportion and enmity that is betweene a Naturall underſtanding and Spirituall Myſteries. <hi>The naturall man, ſaith the Apoſtle, receiveth not the not the thinges of the ſpirit of God, for they are ſpiritually diſcerned,</hi> 1 <hi>Corin.</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:116028:23"/> 2. 14. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, 'tis, ſay ſome expoſitors from the narrowneſſe and incapacity of the intellective faculty to receive thoſe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, In the text indeed they are ſaid to know the things of God but not the things of the ſpirit of God; and good reaſon to for it, for as water can aſcend no higher then juſt the ſpring or fountaine from whence it is derived, even ſo the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which flowes from the light of Nature can mount no further, then into thoſe things which are proportioned and levell with the ſame light. Should you tell a <hi>Pagan</hi> of three diſtinct per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons united in the ſame nature, of an <hi>Infinite</hi> God wrapt up and cloyſterd in <hi>Finite</hi> humane fleſh, of being twice borne before he can become a child of God; would he not (think you) rather laugh at, then believe the diſcourſe, and ſuppoſe you rather went about to puzzle then inſtruct him? Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe a Bat may as ſoone face the Sun at noone day, or a purblind man read the ſmalleſt print at a miles diſtance, as a Carnall man can dive into, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:116028:23"/> ſuch abſtruſe, ſublime <hi>Myſteries.</hi> 'Tis the Word alone and ſpirit of God that unlocks unto us theſe <hi>hidden things of God,</hi> which blockiſh nature can never underſtand, much leſſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover. And therefore when <hi>Paul</hi> ſpoke unto the <hi>Athenians</hi> concerning the Reſurrection, the text ſaith <hi>ſome of them mocked,</hi> and the ſame <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 2. ſaith <hi>the Goſpell was unto the Greekes fooliſhneſſe:</hi> even the moſt learned of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> counted theſe <hi>myſteries</hi> ridiculous and abſurd things. Unto theſe reaſons I might adde many more, and anſwere ſome objections, but I am afraid I ſhould be tedious. Give me leave now but in a word or two particularly to apply of this point unto our ſelves, what hath been Doctrinally ſpoken as touching the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and ſo I ſhall conclude.</p>
            <p>Firſt: then this ſhould make us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile the ſad loſſe we ſuſtained by <hi>Adams Apoſtacy;</hi> us I ſay, for we are all by nature <hi>Gentiles,</hi> neither is there any man borne a Chriſtian, As then when the ſunne is in a very
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:116028:24"/> great Eclipſe, every man is apt to be ſtruct with horrour and Amazement, ſo likewiſe when we conſider, how ſtrange an Eclipſe this <hi>primitive glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous light</hi> hath ſuffered through ſinne, we ought to be ſmitten through with greife, and ſeriouſly to bewaile the cauſe of it. When a man looketh upon the Venerable ruines of ſome ancient, ſtately edifice, how apt is he to weepe and melt over its deſolations? And ſhall Man, that admirable fabrick and Maſter-peice of his Creatour, fall into ſuch confuſion and darkneſſe, and wee be inſenſible of his ruines, and, as <hi>Nero</hi> once did upon <hi>Rome,</hi> looke merrily upon his deſtruction? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, were not a man wholly Engul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed in carnall pleaſures, were not his heart ſo deeply ſteeped in world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delight, he would ſometimes let fall a teare or two upon the ſad reliques of his <hi>Primitive Glory,</hi> and mourne over his former happineſſe, now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toumbed in nothing but Miſery and Darkneſſe. For doubtleſſe great matter there will be of ſorrow unto
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:116028:24"/> us, to ſee that glorious fabrick and beautifull Image of God ſullied over with ſinne and uglineſſe; that <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding which is the candle of the Lord, Prov.</hi> 20. 27. Now ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with ignorance, unbeliefe and falſhood; with ignorance, in being not able to fathome either naturall Cauſes or ſupernaturall myſteries; with unbeliefe, in its backwardneſſe to aſſent unto ſuch things which are beyond the reach of purblind nature; and with falſehood, in its miſappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending and misjudging the truths of God: to ſee likewiſe what rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious tumults and diſorders there are in thoſe <hi>Affections,</hi> which Originally were quietly ſubordinated unto the dictates and guidance of Reaſon; how madly they caſt off the reins, and ruſh into ſinne, as a horſe ruſheth into the battle; how wildly they rage and Tyrannize over the diſcurſive rationall facultie, either bribing it to aſſent unto ſuch things which upon deliberation it muſt needs diſapprove off, or elſe violently tugging and haling it to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:116028:25"/> give way unto the Execution of them. To conſider alſo how that <hi>Conſcience</hi> which primitively did enjoy a ſweet tranquillity and peace, is now laſhed with the guilt of <hi>Sinne,</hi> affrighted with the glarings and preapprehenſions of <hi>Hell fire,</hi> yea and become a very <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a bugbeare unto us, a <hi>ſpeculum</hi> and looking glaſſe to reflect unto us both our Temporall and Eternall mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery. I might here make an <hi>Anatomy</hi> of the whole man, and ſhew unto you how in every part and faculty of the ſoule that <hi>Glorious Light,</hi> which God originally imprinted in our firſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, is now dimme and almoſt quite extinguiſhed through ſinne, ſuch is the ſtrange malignity of it to deface and blurre the cleareſt Characters of God and Goodneſſe in man. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſhould mightily humble every one of us, when we conſider, that the <hi>Light</hi> whereby we primitively were directed unto Heaven, and ſo ſweet a communion with God himſelfe, is now ſo obſcure in us, that we are faine to grope after him in the darke, with
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:116028:25"/> whom before we had ſo familiar Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance. And then it ſhould cauſe us to pray unto God, to enlighten our minds, to repaire this decayed lumpe with the Oyle of his Grace, that we may be enabled to ſeeke after him in the way that he will be found, <hi>to bring us out of darkneſſe into his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous light;</hi> out of the darkneſſe of ignorance, that we may rightly <hi>know him and Jeſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent;</hi> out of the darkneſſe of errour, that we may know the truth, and <hi>diſcerne thinges that differ;</hi> and out of the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of unbeliefe, that <hi>believing on him we may not ſee death, but have everlaſting life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now, ſecondly, as we ought to be humbled in the ſenſe of this our great loſſe, ſo ought we likewiſe, ſince God hath manifeſted it unto us, and it is his gift, to be thankfull for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders and ſparks of this <hi>Light</hi> that now remaine in us: for whereas God might have wrapped us up in eternall darkneſſe, and have made us as brutiſh and irrationall as the Beaſts we for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:116028:26"/> had dominion over, yet ſuch was his goodneſſe to us, that in the middeſt of judgements he remembred mercy; and though by reaſon of ſinne he might have deprived us of the very foot-ſteps and reliques of <hi>Naturall Goodneſſe,</hi> yet hath it pleaſed him ſtill to lend us ſo much light, as may be a witneſſe unto himſelfe, and <hi>a Pole-ſtar</hi> as it were, to direct us in the paths of Goodneſſe and Civility. Admirable hath beene the effects which even this light hath produced from meere natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall men; thoſe <hi>rationall diſcourſes,</hi> and deep ſearchings into the bowels of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, thoſe ſublime and raiſed ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in things <hi>Philoſophicall,</hi> thoſe rare examples of <hi>Temperance, Sobriety,</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and what not? amongſt the very <hi>Heathens,</hi> thoſe curious inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences,</hi> their civill deportment, and exact conformity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the lawes and conſtitutions of their Superiours. What are all theſe, I ſay, and many of the like nature, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts and rayes of this <hi>Light?</hi> But now as water, the further it is from
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:116028:26"/> the fountaine, the leſſe pure and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome is it, ſo that ſtrength of Reaſon in the <hi>Heathen Philoſophers,</hi> by how much the more it wanders from God the Authour of it, by ſo much the more deadly and poyſonous was it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. God did manifeſt unto the <hi>Gentiles</hi> many uſefull and excellent things, but ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>they glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied him not as God, neither were thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but became vaine in their Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and their fooliſh heart was darkned.</hi> Marke the evill fruits of unthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, they did not acknowledge the Author of theſe gifts in them, and what followed? they became <hi>Vaine</hi> in their reaſonings, or diſputations, when God did once leave them unto their owne braines, whereunto they aſcribed all their learning. What ſilly, ſimple con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions did they frame concerning him? ſome, even of their wiſeſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying his <hi>Providence,</hi> others againe thinking, forſooth, that the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the world would be too great a labour for <hi>One</hi> God, devided the burden betweene <hi>Multitudes</hi> of them,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:116028:27"/> 
               <hi>Jupiter, Pluto, Neptune,</hi> and I know not whom of their owne ſtamp and making: ſo ſtrangely was their reaſons infatuated, that though <hi>they profeſſed themſelves to be wiſe, yet they became fooles, and changed the glory of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible God, &amp;c.</hi> Wherefore it mightily concernes every one of us in ſpeciall, whom God hath advanced above the rude and ignorant multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, to aſcribe all our parts and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning unto God, as the Author of <hi>every good and perfect gift:</hi> who as he can inſtill the greateſt Knowledge into the dulleſt piece of earth, ſo can he infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate and deſtroy <hi>the wiſdome of the wiſe, and bring to nothing the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the prudent.</hi> Let not then the <hi>wiſe man glory in his wiſedome.</hi> Alas, without Gods bleſſing 'twill prove un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, as one ſaith, but as the preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtone in a toad's head, rather a diſeaſe then an ornament; and as he ſaid falſly of <hi>Paul,</hi> we may ſay truly of many men, <hi>that much learning hath made them mad:</hi> for there may be a kind of rationall madneſſe; a man may
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:116028:27"/> 
               <hi>cum ratione inſanire,</hi> and that when being unthankfull unto God for what he hath, he makes his learning the fuell of his pride, and ſo by his reaſon argueth himſelfe into hell. Remember the miſerable end of <hi>Herod,</hi> a wiſe and eloquent man without doubt, for ſuch did the plaudit of the people after his oration proclaime him to be; and <hi>yet he was eaten up of wormes.</hi> Why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, ſaith the Text, <hi>he gave not God the glory.</hi> We are apt to aſcribe all our wit and learning unto our owne rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and inventions, but take heed, <hi>God reſiſteth the proud;</hi> he can by one blaſt of his diſpleaſure enfeeble and weaken the powers of the ſoule, beſott and infatuate the ſtrongeſt judgement, befoole and benumme the quickeſt wit; he can ſend an Apoplexy upon thee, to take away thy Memory, as <hi>Pliny</hi> ſomewhere reports of <hi>Meſſala Corvinus,</hi> that after a ſickneſſe he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got his owne name: he can lay aſleep our underſtanding in a Lethargie, yea he can in the middeſt of our pride and unthankfulneſſe diſſolve into nothing
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:116028:28"/> by a ſudden death all our arts and learning, and then <hi>where is the wiſe? where is the Scribe? where is the diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this world?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The conſideration of that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God and thoſe morall vertues in the very <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſhould ſhame and reprove many amongſt us, who, even amidſt the glorious <hi>Light</hi> of the Holy Goſpell, do fall farre ſhort of them. There are many men, even in the Chriſtian world, who, out of a certain proud curioſity, and damnable <hi>Scepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſme,</hi> will call into queſtion the very being of God, and thinke they are then more learned, when they contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the unanimous conſent and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of all men: and there are others againe, who, out of an affected kind of <hi>Atheiſme,</hi> and that they might better practiſe their impieties, do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſuppreſſe and ſmother all thoughts ariſing in them of God, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, Reſurrection, Heaven, and Hell. The former of theſe you may terme the <hi>Speculative,</hi> the latter the <hi>Practicall Atheiſt,</hi> then whom, ſaith
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:116028:28"/>

Wee anſwere that the originall and primary end why God primitively impreſſed upon man the light of nature and the knowledge of the creatures, was that thereby he might know and worſhip him aright; for had man continued in his <hi>Created</hi>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:116028:36"/> 
               <hi>integrity,</hi> theſe two Bookes had beene ſufficient to inſtruct him in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his Maker; but now man by ſinne having defaced that <hi>Glorious I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage</hi> of God wherein he was made, it was not poſſible for him either by the light of <hi>Nature,</hi> or conduct of the <hi>Creatures</hi> to attaine unto Heaven: there being another new way found out to ſave man, even by the <hi>Blood of Jeſus,</hi> the two former are made al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ineffectuall, either to guide him in the true <hi>Worſhip</hi> of God, or inſtruct him in any <hi>ſaving knowledge</hi> of him. Well then, what muſt be the end and uſe of them? they remaine ſtill that's certaine, the light of <hi>Nature</hi> is yet in us, though much blotted, the <hi>Creatures</hi> in themſelves are as ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to guide us unto God, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, though through man's <hi>Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> and <hi>Ignorance</hi> they are made ineffectuall: therefore there muſt needs ſtep in another end and uſe of them, and that is to ſtop our mouthes, and make us void of excuſe before God.

So then the Eſſentiall, Primary end of the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> and the <hi>Creatures</hi> was to inſtruct man in the <hi>knowledge</hi> and true <hi>worſhip</hi> of God; the conſequentiall, if I may ſo terme it, and accidentary end is to the intent that they may be without excuſe.

            <p>But thus much concerning the firſt point, which is to ſhew in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall that God is every where procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and ſet forth by his <hi>Creatures.</hi> We ſhall now, ſecondly, ſhew you how, and in what way God may be knowne by his <hi>Creatures.

His ſecond way is by conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the <hi>Elements</hi> below; that the wild raging <hi>Ocean</hi> ſhould not preſently overſlow the whole face of the ground and that the <hi>Earth,</hi> naturally the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieſt of all ſimple bodies, ſhould yet for all that be above the <hi>Waters:</hi> doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe this is not from any blind <hi>chaunce</hi>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:116028:42"/> or <hi>fortune,</hi> but from a God, which ſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the raging of the <hi>Seas</hi> and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the <hi>Waves,</hi> and who, from the creation, for the good &amp; commodity of man, gave the <hi>Earth</hi> the upper hand of the <hi>Waters.</hi> His third way, is from the ſtructure of <hi>Mans Body;</hi> wee neede go no further then our ſelves (as you ſhall heare more at large) for the knowledge of God: he is the worſe of <hi>Scepticks,</hi> that will deny himſelfe, and the truth of his owne being; and he the moſt ignorant of <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> who cannot from himſelfe conclude a God. 4. From the invention of <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Sciences,</hi> which doubtleſſe are from God as being only the <hi>Authour of every good and perfect gift.</hi> His fifth and laſt way, is from the <hi>Command</hi> and <hi>Rule</hi> which men have over <hi>Other Creatures;</hi> for doubtleſſe 'tis God alone and not chance that cauſeth beaſts of farre greater ſtrength then any man patiently to ſubmit unto his <hi>yoke</hi> and <hi>dominion.</hi> Theſe are the five waies of <hi>Theodoret</hi> by the which (ſaith he) we may come to know God.
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:116028:42"/> But I dare not treſpaſſe ſo much upon you, as particularly to explaine them. I ſhall only therefore in generall ſhew by what degrees and ſteps, or rather, by what kind of workings the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding may argue from the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> to the <hi>Creatour:</hi> and the firſt way by which we may thus know God, is <hi>per viam negationis,</hi> by <hi>denying:</hi> that is, ſuch things to the <hi>Creatour,</hi> which we find to be imperfections and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in the <hi>Creature;</hi> for when a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall mind</hi> ſhall conſider that corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which the <hi>Creature</hi> is ſubject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, thoſe blemiſhes which it is ſullied withall, it muſt needs conclude ſome <hi>higher Being,</hi> which is not incident to any of theſe.

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:116028:43"/> there is a God, who is all goodneſſe, all truth, becauſe he ſees the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> depending on him, to have ſomething of theſe in him; ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe may he <hi>negatively</hi> conclude, that there is a God, who is neither Finite, of limited Power, or in a Place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſees theſe to be Imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Impotencies in the very <hi>Creatures.</hi> As for example, to explaine my meaning, in a curious <hi>Picture</hi> a man may not onely diſcover the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent art of the <hi>Limner,</hi> but alſo gather, that though it be <hi>quatenùs a Picture</hi> very Exact and Perfect, yet that it is withall very much deficient, and deſtitute of thoſe perfections of the <hi>Limner,</hi> life, ſenſe, and motion: ſo likewiſe though the <hi>Creature, ſub ratione creaturae,</hi> may be in it's kind perfect, yet we may notwithſtanding, from it's being a <hi>Creature</hi> Finite, and limited, conclude that there is a God, who is not ſubject to this Finiteneſſe, and limitedneſſe, but is an Infinite, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible God, <hi>Bleſſed for ever.</hi>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:116028:44"/> The ſecond way by which we may gather that there is a God by the <hi>Creatures,</hi> is <hi>per viam cauſalitatis,</hi> by way of cauſality and influence (as I may ſo terme it;) for when a man ſhall looke out into the world, and behold the admirable and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Palace,</hi> how ſtately it is roofed above with an <hi>Heaven,</hi> every where ſpangled and adorned with ſhining <hi>Pearle-like Starres,</hi> how curiouſly 'tis paved below with an <hi>Earth,</hi> alwaies teeming with <hi>Riches</hi> and <hi>Varieties,</hi> how ſtrongly fenced and walled about with an <hi>Ocean</hi> full of thoſe ſcaly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, the <hi>Fiſh</hi> thereof; when we conſider (I ſay) the <hi>World</hi> with the <hi>Glory</hi> thereof, we muſt needs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge ſome one as the <hi>Firſt cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer</hi> of it; and unto whoſe glory, as it's ultimate end, it is ordained, even God Almighty, <hi>From whom and unto whom are all things.</hi> As in the viewing of a <hi>Clocke,</hi> the hammer ſtriking upon the bell, leads us unto the next wheele, that immediately moves it, this wheele

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:116028:45"/> eaſe the mind in it's inquiries and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings upon the reaſons of things. The inconveniences that would follow u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon ſuch a poſition were (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) next unto the <hi>Light of Nature,</hi> the maine ground and motive that made the <hi>Heathen</hi> acknowledge a God: and hence it was too (as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) that though many amongſt the <hi>Heathens</hi> maintained the <hi>World</hi> to be <hi>Eternall,</hi> yet they acknowledged with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all God as the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of it: As the Sun is the cauſe of light, though light be coëxiſtent with the Sunne. True, there were ſome few amongſt them, who held that God was not the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of the world, but <hi>Auſtin</hi> very well cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led this their opinion <hi>intollerabilis er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,</hi> a moſt intollerable, ſenſeleſſe er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, as being repugnant to the very <hi>Light of Nature,</hi> and convictions they might have from the very <hi>Creatures</hi> themſelves. I might here enter very pertinently upon a diſcourſe againſt the <hi>Eternity</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> but it being a buſineſſe of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> and beſides
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:116028:45"/> having not had time to weigh and debate the matter in mine owne thoughts, I ſhall omit it. What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines is this, that God by way of <hi>Cauſality,</hi> or by our arguing from the <hi>effect</hi> to the <hi>cauſe,</hi> may be known in the <hi>Creatures.</hi> The third way by which we may know God in his <hi>Creatures</hi> is <hi>per viam eminentiae,</hi> which floweth from the two former: for becauſe God hath not thoſe Imperfections in <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>Operation</hi> as his <hi>Creatures</hi> have, and becauſe he is the <hi>Prime Cauſe</hi> and <hi>Mover</hi> of all things, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it will follow, that he is the moſt <hi>Perfect Being,</hi> that he doth <hi>Eminently</hi> containe whatſoever worth and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is ſcattered in his <hi>Creatures:</hi> as we may argue and ſay, that becauſe all light that is in the aire, be it little or much, proceedeth from the Sunne, and therefore the Sunne hath it in a more eminent and excellent degree; ſo likewiſe may we conclude, that ſince all Power, Goodneſſe, Love, and the like, iſſueth from God unto the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:116028:46"/> therefore God hath theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more excellent in him, then the <hi>Creatures.</hi> Therefore we read that <hi>in God are riches of grace, and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of wiſdome,</hi> and the like: <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>In the Creature</hi> there is no <hi>Goodneſſe,</hi> but what is <hi>derivative</hi> and participated of God, but what is dregg'd and allayd with evill, and therefore Finite and Limited. But now <hi>Goodneſſe</hi> is <hi>Eſſentiall</hi> unto God, and therefore, as himſelfe, is Infinite, Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, pure, without meaſure; and therefore as the <hi>Sunne</hi> hath for theſe many yeares together ſcattered light, and influence, dayes and yeares upon the world, and yet doth ſtill remaine the ſame <hi>Sunne,</hi> as full of light as ever; ſo likewiſe, though God from the <hi>Creation</hi> of the world hath not ceaſed continually to beſtow, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate his riches unto his ſeverall <hi>Creatures,</hi> yet he is ſtill the ſame God, as <hi>Rich in Goodneſſe</hi> as ever. Wherefore doubtleſſe it will come to paſſe, that by theſe glimmerings,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:116028:46"/> and faint rayes of <hi>Goodneſſe</hi> in the <hi>Creatures,</hi> a meere Naturall man, an <hi>Heathen</hi> may conclude that there is a God, in whom ſuch <hi>Goodneſſe dwelleth</hi> more fully and plentifully.</p>

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:116028:58"/> may be light, and yet not appeare ſo to be unto a blind man, the ſame booke plaine and legible, and yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to dull and dimme eyes, darke and obſcure; in like manner, the ſame things, which are plaine and perſpicuous unto the Godly Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate men, whoſe eyes God openeth, are for the moſt riddles and ſtrange things unto the wicked, whom the God of this world hath blinded: we ſhall therefore in the Second place ſhew you, that they are more or leſſe perſpicuous according to the diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ſubjects entertaining them; <hi>objective,</hi> and in themſelves, they are perſpicuous, but <hi>ſubjective,</hi> &amp; in reſpect of men, they are more or leſſe plaine, according as men are Regenerated or Unregenerated: the whole world you know is divided into the Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate and Unregenerate, this is an adequate diviſion of all men, and therefore we ſhall</p>
            <p n="1">1. Enquire concerning the the plainneſſe and obſcurity of the Scriptures in relation unto irrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:116028:58"/> men, and we ſhall lay downe this <hi>poſition, that noe wicked irregenerate man can ſavingly know the Scriptures;</hi> or thus, that the Scriptures though plaine in their natures, are yet darke and obſcure unto irregenerate men: <hi>If our Goſpell be hid, it is hid to them that are loſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 3. our Goſpel ſaith the Apoſtle is as cleare as the light, but who can finde fault with the Sun if it gives not light to a blinde man, it is hid indeed, but then it is to thoſe that are loſt, to ungodly men; <hi>for the carnall man preceiveth not the things of the Spirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. the Scriptures all throughout contain in them Spirituall things, and therefore as a meer ſenſible Creature cannot judge of the diſcourſes and reaſonings of men, ſo neither can a meer rationall man perceive or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcover the Myſteries of the Spirit, which is only proper to him, unto whom the Spirit revealeth them, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> elſewhere ſpeakes; you know the Scripture is devided into the Law and the Goſpell, and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate men are ſaid to be either
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:116028:59"/> within or without the Church, now an unregenerate man, a <hi>Gentile</hi> without the Church, may have an hiſtoricall knowledge of the Law, for ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle Rom.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>they doe by nature the things contained in the Law,</hi> but as from an <hi>old eaten manuſcript</hi> a man may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a word or ſentence or two, when yet notwithſtanding he is not able to find out the drift, ſcope, and end of it, becauſe through its ancientneſſe it is much worne and periſhed; in like manner from thoſe old reliques and veſtigies of <hi>that Law written in the hearts</hi> of the Gentiles they might diſcover ſome things which pertained unto their dutyes towards God and their Neighbour, but then they could not know therefrom the intent of the Law, which was to drive them to a <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they could not know, that by it they could not be juſtifyed, they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood not the end and drift for which God wrote this Law in their hearts, &amp; therefore though they might have an Hiſtoricall, yet they could not have a Saving knowledg thereof.</p>
            <pb n="123" facs="tcp:116028:59"/>
            <p> But Secondly, as for the Goſpell, a Gentile cannot have either an Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoricall or ſaving knowledge of it without it be preached unto them, or by ſome extraordinary way, unknown unto us, infuſed into them, for <hi>Faith (ordinarily, that is) commeth by hearing, and hearing by the word of God,</hi> therefore the opinion of thoſe, who think that by the light of nature a man may come to the knowledge of Chriſt and the Goſpell, is to be rejected.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly a Chriſtian unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man within the Church, may have an Hiſtoricall contemplative knowledge of the Law and Goſpell, but no ſaving particular knowledge of either, for it is to them fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14. and therefore it is rather a ſcandall and ſtumbling block unto them, then a light and ſaving rule, it cannot be expected therefore that the Scriptures ſhould ſeem plain unto them, whoſe noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome luſts doe caſt a miſt and a cloud before their underſtandings, and whoſe intereſts and prejudices againſt
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:116028:60"/> the Doctrine of them, ſuffereth them not to behold their purity and cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. <hi>Secondly,</hi> as ungodly irregenerate men cannot have any ſaving cleer knowledge of the Scriptures; ſo on the contrary, Godly regenerate Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians may have it: for unto them alone it is given to know the ſecrets of the Kingdome of God, but to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in parables, that when they ſee, they ſhould not ſee, and when they heare, they ſhould not underſtand; and ſo 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3 15, 16. tis ſaid, untill this day <hi>when Moſes is read the vaile is laid over their hearts,</hi> nevertheleſſe, when they ſhall turne unto the Lord, the Vaile ſhall be taken away. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and the Spirit of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth remove all obſtacles, and diſpell all clouds, which doe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe overcaſt the underſtandings of naturall men; there are many things contained in Scripture, there is Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which in generall, though not in each particular circumſtance, may eaſily be underſtood of an enlightned Chriſtian; there are Propheſyes
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:116028:60"/> which are either fulfilled, or yet remain unaccompliſhed, the former may be known by applications of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, the latter we may aſſure our ſelves will be fulfilled in their appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted time; there are commands of God, which being a declaration of his will, are plainely ſet down, and are as plainely underſtood, for a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian knoweth the mind of Chriſt, and the will of his Father; there are alſo Promiſes, which being made only to Gods Children, are by them only rightly apprehended, <hi>for unto Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham and his ſeed were the Promiſes, Gal.</hi> 3. 16. There are laſtly, threatnings, which being denounced againſt ſinne, are truely feared of thoſe alone who make conſcience of ſinning; as a ſtrange language doth ſeem very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth and ridiculous, unto ſuch as have no experience of it, whereas on the contrary, it is moſt acceptable and delightfull to ſuch as underſtand it: in like manner the language of the Scriptures, however they may ſeem ſtrange and unreaſonable to ſuch as
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:116028:61"/> are not acquainted with God and his holy Word, yet to a Regenerate Child of God, and ſuch an one as rightly underſtands them, they are had in great eſteeme, yea and are more precious to them then the hony or the hony-combe; now we delight only in ſuch things which we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, for <hi>Knowledge according to Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle is the reſt of the Soule,</hi> a man may pore and reade all day in a Booke, yet if he underſtandeth not, 'twill mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter little comfort, or pleaſure to him, and therefore the Scriptures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo great a delight unto the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for ſaith <hi>David,</hi> My delight is in thy Law, and my ſtudy therein day and night, it will follow, that they doe eaſily underſtand the meaning of them: but may ſome one ſay, doth not <hi>David</hi> pray alſo unto God to give him underſtanding that he may learne his Commandements, how are they then ſo eaſily to be underſtood of an Elect Child of God? wee anſwer, that in this place <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119. 73. the Prophet doth not ſpeake of an outward un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:116028:61"/> of the Scriptures, for who doubteth but that a Gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall and Hiſtoricall knowledge he had of them, but he prayeth for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward aſſurance &amp; comfort from them, which ought continually to be the prayers of every one who intends to benefit by the reading of them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, this availeth nothing, for we do not ſay that the Scriptures are plaine unto any, without Gods ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their eyes, and revealing unto them the myſteryes of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: farther, a man may ſay, that if the Scriptures are thus plaine, as you will have them, what need you then take all this paines in expounding of them, to what purpoſe are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Commentators and Interpreters of them? We anſwer, that though the Doctrine of Faith be plainely ſet down, yet other things there be in the Scripture, which may by reaſon of our ignorance ſtand in need of a Commentary, which alſo may be farther uſefull for the more largely opening of the Scripture, which a new
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:116028:62"/> beginner cannot doe himſelf, thus the Elements of <hi>Euclide</hi> are very plaine &amp; perſpicuous in themſelves, though notwithſtanding for the benefit of young beginners they are farther illuſtrated and demonſtrated by thoſe that write on him: thus you ſee then, that the Scriptures are plain and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous unto a Regenerate Child of God, though unto wicked Unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate men of the world they may appeare otherwiſe, not through any defect of light in themſelves, but through the muddineſſe and darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of their own minds; As unto diſeaſed and ill affected eyes, all things even the brighteſt, will appeare of the ſame yellow colour that they at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent are affected with.</p>
            <p>But here I had almoſt forgotten to put you in mind of this caution: <hi>viz.</hi> That though all things neceſſary unto Salvation are plainely delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in Scriptures, yet that they were not ſo plainely held forth unto the Faithfull under the old Teſtament, us now they are unto them under the
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:116028:62"/> New, for we muſt know that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes under the Law were either Clouded and Mufled up in <hi>Types</hi> and <hi>Figures,</hi> or elſe couched and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed only in <hi>Symbolicall</hi> figurative expreſſions; for the Prophets of old did ſeldome ſpeake but in figures: <hi>Moſes</hi> his face did ſhine indeed, but then there was a vaile over it, and ſo Chriſt was repreſented indeed under the Old Teſtament, but through a cloud and miſt, hence the <hi>Apoſtle ſaith that the myſtery of the Goſpell was kept ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ſince the world began, but now 'tis made manifeſt;</hi> that is, compare the times of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> with theſe of the <hi>New,</hi> &amp; the Goſpell then will ſeeme quite to have been hid, in compariſon of what it is now, for ſo we muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the words, it being the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Scriptures, when they compare two things together, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the leſſe negatively: a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt without doubt the ancient Jewes had, for otherwiſe to what purpoſe would it be ſaid <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 56. <hi>Your Father Abraham rejoyced to ſee</hi>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:116028:63"/> 
               <hi>my day, &amp; he ſow it, &amp; was glad, &amp; that they dranck of that Spirituall Rock that followed them, and that rock was Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4. to what purpoſe alſo would thoſe <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes</hi> &amp; <hi>Propheſys</hi> of Chriſt be, unles they had had ſome knowledg of him; a knowledg then they had of him, that's certain, but then this was only a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, implicite knowledg of him, not a diſtinct, particular, &amp; explicite one: as now we know in general, that great will be the Glory that ſhall be revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon us in Heaven, both in body and ſoule; but yet we cannot define certainely what kind of Glory it will be, untill this Mortall ſhall have put on Immortallity, this Corruption that Incorruption: ſo likewiſe the Patriarchs of old knew, and believed in a Chriſt to come, but then they did not explicitely and diſtinctly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand his particular Offices, his Death and Reſurrection, and the like, <hi>for of theſe the Apoſtle tels us for a time,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the fuller manifeſtation of theſe myſteryes was reſerved untill the fullneſſe of time, and the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:116028:63"/> of them; hence the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, that the Fathers of Old did not actually receive the Promiſes, but ſaith he, they ſaw them afarre off, and were perſwaded of them, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 13. As therefore a man by the help of a glaſſe may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover another at three or four miles diſtance, and not be able diſtinctly and throughly to view him all over; ſo likewiſe the faithfull in old time, thorough the glaſſe of the Law, did know Chriſts comming; but then they ſaw him afarre off, ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, and therefore he could not circumſtantially and cleerly be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted unto them; and ſo likewiſe it is in relation unto the knowledge of the Trinity and other myſteries; they were darkely and emblematically, as I may ſo ſpeake, hinted only in the Old Teſtament, God thus ordering it, that his people might more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly deſire and pray for their fuller revelation. But now to us under the New Teſtament, theſe things are more cleerly layd open unto us, ſo
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:116028:64"/> that we ought not to exſpect farther <hi>revelation</hi> of them, then what we have in the Word already; for ſaith the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, All the Promiſes of God in him are yea and Amen:</hi> that is, they are through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accompliſh't and perfected in him, and therefore they muſt needs be more plain and evident unto us now, then they were unto the Fathers of old time: the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> then, and the matter therein contained, was not altogether ſo perſpicuous unto the faithfull before Chriſt, as now it is unto us after him: and this ſhall ſuffice for the ſecond point, and ſo much alſo ſhall ſuffice briefely for the perſpicuity of the Scriptures. We ſhall now ſpeake ſomething concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the perfection of them; as the Scriptures are perſpicuous, ſo alſo they are moſt perfect, (that is) neceſſary to be known of us in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion both to our faith &amp; manners: this is plain from the end of them here ſet down, Namely, <hi>that the man of God may be made perfect, throughly furniſhed unto all good workes:</hi> from whence we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:116028:64"/> that if the Miniſter of the Goſpell, for he is the man of God, may out of the Scriptures furniſh himſelfe with all things neceſſary, both for his Salvation &amp; his office, it will follow that they are fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect for inſtruction of all men, both in Doctrine and manners; this will farther appeare from <hi>Pſ.</hi> 19. 7. <hi>The Law of the Lord is perfect, converting the ſoule:</hi> and <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119. 96. <hi>I have ſeen an end of all perfections, but thy commandement is exceeding large:</hi> and ſo <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. 29. <hi>Abraham</hi> there ſheweth in the Parable, that <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets were ſufficient to keepe men from dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, even the doctrine of the Old Teſtament contains in it al things neceſſary for mans Salvation: who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever denyeth the truth of this point, muſt of neceſſity ſay, that either <hi>firſt</hi> God did not perfectly and fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale his will to the Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles: which how abſurd it is the Scriptures teach; for <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 26.

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:116028:66"/> names of <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi> mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by <hi>Paul</hi> only, the Propheſy of <hi>Enoch, Jude</hi> 14. part of the <hi>Gencology</hi> of Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3 Sathan ſtriving for <hi>Moſes</hi> body, <hi>Jude</hi> 9. and other the like, which things they may be known or not known, without any prejudice to our Salvation; and being not doctrinall, may very well be received from hand to hand, and not mentioned in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: but how ſay the Papiſts, can ye know <hi>Canonicall</hi> bookes from <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criphall</hi> but by the tradition of the Church? We anſwer, that theſe may be diſtinguiſh't from the other, by that innate light, majeſty, and truth that is in them; beſides, though a new convert and beginner may firſt learne it from the Church, yet afterwards they know it upon grounds of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; thus an ignorant man may be told of the Kings coine, but it is not that telling, but the Kings ſtampe that maketh it currant &amp; good <hi>coyn.</hi> Again, for the maintenance of their <hi>unwritten traditions</hi> they urge that of the 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 15. <hi>Therefore brethren ſtand faſt, &amp; hold</hi>

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:116028:67"/> ſince theſe Scriptures are purpoſely written for our learning, and to be are witneſſe of Chriſt, and to teach the way unto everlaſting life, doubtleſſe God will have no Doctrine received of us but what is in them, or conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant unto them; Traditions then however in point of ceremony, diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, or other leſſe ſubſtantiall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, may be received, yet in points of faith and Doctrine they are in no wiſe to be obtruded upon us, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained by us. And thus much briefely for the Authority, Perſpicui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Perfection of the Scriptures, concerning which, I might have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken far more largely out of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Common-places, Catechiſts, and Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall Divines,</hi> but intending brevity upon this point, I thought it more uſefull for you and my ſelfe, wholy to examine the aforeſaid points by Scripture, yet ſo, that I have given you a ſhort glance and view of what they have ſaid too.

So may we ſay of the Scriptures, there is none to them, the word of God is as a two edged ſword dividing between the Joynts and the Marrow, ſo that what <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaid of the knowledge of the ſoul, that a little of it was better then a great deal of another ſcience: We may alſo ſay of the knowledge of the holy Scriptures, a little knowledge of them will ſtand us in more ſteed, then all the vaine and periſhing knowledge of prophane Writers: Could the time and ſhortneſſe of our lives ſuffer us to ſwallow up and devoure whole <hi>Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> as bigge as that of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> or
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:116028:68"/> this of our own: were it poſſible for us critically to go over and examine all thoſe elaborated pieces of humane invention, could we perfectly Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mize and trace nature in all her ſecret windings and operations; yet all this knowledge in it ſelfe, however it may place us above the clouds in mens o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, may for all that be an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for God to hurle us deeper into Hell: But behold here a Book, that is able to make us wiſe unto Salvation, that directs and points us out a way unto eternall Life, yea which raiſeth our minds up unto the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe myſteries, which the <hi>Angels themſelves did deſire to peep into;</hi> a Book that unlocks unto us the very Cabinetand ſecret Counſells of God himſelfe, that revealeth and layeth open thoſe myſteries of Godlineſſe, thoſe hidden things of God, which were before from all eternity claſped up in the hoſome of the Almighty, that gives a landskip as 'twere, and map of Heavenly Joy, that out of darkeneſſe brings us into marvellous
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:116028:68"/> light, that maketh us from Children of wrath to become heires of Heaven; from ſlaves freeborne; from Divells to become Saints. All other bookes, either by the teeth of time are worne out of memory, or in the ruines of Kingdomes receive their graves, but not one jot or tittle of this ſhall paſſe away, 'till all things be fulfilled. It hath been hitherto for ſome thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand yeares preſerved amid'ſt the hatred of all the world againſt it, the perſecutions of Tyrants, the malice and fury of Divells, and ſhall ſo unto the end of the world continue, though wicked men, Tyrants, and Divels ſhould all combine their joynt forces to extinguiſh it, they may with more ſucceſſe and eaſineſſe goe about to blot the Sunne out of the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then to take this glorious Light from the Church &amp; people of God: ſo that it was not without much reaſon that a holy Man once ſaid, <hi>That he had rather all the books beſide in the world ſhould be burnt, than that one leafe of Gods Word ſhould be deſtroyed:</hi> for doubtleſſe

               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:116028:70"/> to know the propriety of words: <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> to underſtand the ſeverall <hi>Tropes</hi> and figures contained therein: <hi>Logick,</hi> to deduce conſequences, and artificially to open places of Scripture: and all three together, properly and diſtinctly to analyſe, reſolve, and open the particular chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Bookes thereof; which I conceive to be the neareſt, and moſt compendious way for the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the drift and ſcope of Holy writ: now all theſe ſhould be as ſo many ſeverall tyes and engagements upon us continually to ſtrike upon this anvile, night and day to ſtudy, read, and meditate upon the Holy Scriptures, eſpecially for us who either actually are in, or elſe intend the calling of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry. But what may ſome of the younger ſort here ſay, if the Scriptures be ſo hard as you make them, your exhortation will little prevaile with us, you will rather deterre us from reading them: to ſuch I anſwer, that though many things in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:116028:71"/> be hard, yet the maine Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines thereof, which concerne our Salvation, are plainly ſet down, and as eaſily to be underſtood; beſides, as the <hi>Oratour</hi> notes of the Elements of Sciences, and Sciences themſelves, that <hi>they ſeem hard and difficult only to the firſt undertakers of them:</hi> ſo may we ſay of the Holy Scriptures, their ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming difficulties will eaſily be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, and made unto thoſe that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly uſe &amp; read them, as a ſtrange language by uſe and cuſtome becomes eaſy and familiar; there are many things indeed in <hi>holy writ</hi> foulded up in obſcurity, but this is to make us more earneſtly pray unto God to open our eyes, <hi>that we may behold the wondrous things of his Law:</hi> this is to tame the pride and arrogance of our nature, which is apt to ſpurne and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value things obvious, this is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame and raiſe up a generous holy minde unto a continuall reading and ſtudying of them; for as we count that man moſt valiant, who will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon hard and difficult enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:116028:71"/> in like manner may we eſteem that man moſt holy and beſt minded, who will (as I may ſo ſpeake) dare to be pious, and conquer all the ſeeming difficulties of the Holy Scriptures with his deſire to know them, and his induſtry to find them out; wherefore as the voice once ſaid unto <hi>Auſtin,</hi> ſo let me ſay unto you all, <hi>tollite, legite,</hi> take up the word, read it; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you may find ſomething therein that may dampe and frighten your wild luſts, as they ſay that <hi>holy Father</hi> was preſently converted upon the reading of that text <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 12. <hi>The night is farre ſpent, the day is at hand, let us therefore caſt off the workes of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and put on the armour of light: tollite, legite,</hi> perhaps you may finde there ſomething that may ſtrike into your ſoules an holy amazement and ſacred horrour for your ſins paſt, as <hi>Junius</hi> ſaith of himſelfe, <hi>that he was ſtrucken with amazement by a divine kind of Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and ſo turned from his Atheiſme upon the reading of the</hi> 1 <hi>Chapter of John:</hi> Againe, <hi>tollite, legite,</hi> perhaps you ſaw
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:116028:72"/> light through ſome temptations an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, ſome grievances of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence pacifyed upon thy diligent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of his word, ſome judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment denounced againſt thy ſinnes, ſome good thing or other, that may either comfort thee, or encourage thee in thy farther reading of them: <hi>tollite, legite,</hi> take it up and read it, but read it with reverence, it is the Word of God, read it with diſcretion and judgements, by marking the connexion of them, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring one place with another, and by examining all things accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Analogy of Faith, and by applying that which thou readeſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy own particular uſe and eſtate: read it laſtly with method and order, diſtinctly going over that Booke which thou undertakeſt, leaſt thou be <hi>always learning and never come to the knowledge of the truth.</hi> Oh but read it I doe, perhaps two Chapters a day, beſides I heare it read twice a day in this very place, but yet I can find no Spirituall comfort from it, it doth not
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:116028:72"/> move me for all that, what ſhall I doe then to have comfort from it? The anſwering of this caſe will be very proper for us; for many of us I doubt not doe heare and read the word, but then I feare we are as little moved with it as the benches we ſit upon, or the ground we tread on; but let ſuch a man conſider his fearfull eſtate, who can thus heare judgements de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced and yet not be ſhaken, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies promiſed and yet not be melted; let him conſider what a fearfull thing it is to heare or read God ſpeaking, and he to have his mind another way, for God to thunder out in his Word, and yet he to ſleep all the while ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely in his ſinne: how can he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect Heaven who is thus careleſſe of the inſtrument of his Salvation? doubtleſſe that God who comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Jewes in the 6. <hi>Deut.</hi> 8. <hi>To bind his Laws for a ſigne upon their hands, and that they ſhould be as frontlets between their eyes, and that they ſhould write them upon the poſts and gates of their houſes,</hi> muſt needs be mightily provoked at
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:116028:73"/> their contempt, who will not give his word any admiſſion into their hearts or eares, wherefore if ſuch men doe deſire to be moved, or to receive any comfort from their reading or hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the word,</p>
            <p n="1">1. They muſt continually pray unto God to take from them <hi>their heart of ſtone, and give unto them an heart of fleſh,</hi> beſtow upon them likewiſe <hi>the Spirit of wiſedome and revelation of the knowledge of him that the eyes of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding being enlightned, they may know what is the hope of their calling, Epheſ.</hi> 1. 16, 17.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They muſt examine themſelves what worldly cares doe diſtract their minds, what prejudices and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions doe enter into their hearts at the reading of the Word, which are <hi>like the thornes</hi> (in the parable) <hi>choaking the good ſeed of the Word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. They muſt ſeriouſly meditate upon the Word, read, and endeavour to remember it, for as meat doth that man little good, whoſe ſtomacke hath not a retentive faculty in it to
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:116028:73"/> retaine and diſgeſt it, in like manner the Word of God being not chewed upon (as 'twere) by meditation, and well remembred, doth become uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and unprofitable to us; ſo then we muſt not only read the Word, but we muſt practice it alſo, we muſt lay it up in our hearts, and bring forth the fruits of it in a holy and Godly Converſation. I might here farther enlarge upon this point, and confirme my exhortation of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the holy Scriptures from their plainneſſe and perfection, their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and matter of them altogether divine, from their end, the Glory of God and mans Salvation, from their principall Author, GOD, and from many other Arguments, but I ſhall crave leave here abruptly to break off and conclude.</p>

Adde to all theſe the teſtimonies of all times concerning the Scriptures, their <hi>Antiquity, Moſes</hi> being borne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the very Gods of the Heathens, the lateſt of the <hi>Prophets</hi> matching the antienteſt of the <hi>Phyloſophers;</hi> adde alſo their conſtant preſervation and continuance even till now, maugre all the fury and rage of <hi>Tyrants,</hi> the malice of <hi>Divells</hi> and diveliſh men, who have done, and doe ſtill oppoſe theſe holy writings; adde finally unto all theſe, the teſtimonies of an army
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:116028:89"/> of <hi>Martyrs,</hi> maintaining even to death the truth of the Scriptures; men of all ſorts, ignorant, who though they could not diſpute, could yet dye for the truth, wiſe, rich, poore, of all ages and ſexes, women, children, aged folkes, enduring all manner of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with all manner of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with all patience and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy for the maintenance of Gods Word, and the truthes therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; theſe with many other reaſons may ſufficiently demonſtrate, that God alone is the <hi>Author</hi> of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: but now as there may be many witneſſes unto a bond, and yet ſtill all be of little moment, unleſſe the ſeale be put on too, in like manner all theſe witneſſes and arguments here produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced will be of little concernement unto our Salvation, unleſſe they be <hi>ſealed with the Spirit of promiſe,</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeakes <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 13. we may be convicted by the foregoing argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that God is the Authour of the Holy Scriptures, but yet they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>per ſe</hi> worke faith nor a full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of them, unleſſe the Spirit which
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:116028:90"/> beareth witneſſe unto our Spirits, jointly cooperates and opens our eyes more fully to ſee this light: for as <hi>Hagar, Gen.</hi> 21. 19. could not ſee the fountain that was neer her untill God had opened her eyes, ſo neither can we perfectly diſcerne or ſavingly know the holy Scriptures untill the Holy Ghoſt doth open our eyes, as <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>to behold the marvellous things of the Law:</hi> we have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore occaſion here to enquire, how it may appeare unto us that the Scriptures are the Word of God, or how a man may ſavingly and truely know that the Scriptures are the Word of God and of divine authority? the <hi>Papiſts</hi> they ſay that the reaſon why they believe the Scriptures are the Word of God, is becauſe the Church ſaith ſo, we ſay that the reaſon why we believe them ſo to be, is becauſe they are in themſelves worthy of all beliefe, and becauſe the Spirit of God witneſſeth and ſealeth unto our Spirits <hi>that they are the Word, of God;</hi> now whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:116028:90"/> the witneſſe of men, or the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God be greater, judge ye: however it hath been a point very much controverted and canvaſſed on both ſides, therefore I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour briefly and cleerly to ſtate it, and to make you underſtand the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity and vanity of their poſition. Our <hi>theſis,</hi> on which I ſhall ground my Diſcourſe, ſhall be this, namely that the Authority of the Scriptures <hi>in eſſe cognito</hi> and <hi>quoad nos</hi> doth not ſo depend on the Church as on their own innate light, and teſtimony of the Spirit within us: the termes of this Theſis being explained you will eaſily underſtand the whole matter; I ſay then, that the Authority of the Scriptures <hi>in eſſe cognito,</hi> and <hi>quoad nos,</hi> for though ſome of the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have been ſo impudent as to affirme, that the Scriptures have no more divine authority in them without the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Church, then <hi>Aeſops Fables</hi> or <hi>Ovid's Metamorphoſis</hi> hath, yet ſome of the moderne and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous of them doe acknowledge, that
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:116028:91"/> in themſelves indeed they are of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine authority, yet this cannot (ſay they) otherwiſe appeare unto us then by the teſtimony of the Church: we ſay then, that they may otherwiſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare unto us to be Gods Word then by the church, as we may know that light is light, and gold is gold by their owne qualities and luſtre, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any mans telling of us that they are ſo; beſides, if they are as they confeſſe of divine authority in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by what Law then can their Church uſurpe authority over them, unleſſe (as needs it muſt come to paſſe) they account the authority of their Church above that of God, and ſo become no leſſe blaſphemers then abſurd.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I ſay, that the authority of the Scriptures in <hi>eſſe cognito</hi> and <hi>quoad nos,</hi> doth not ſo much depend upon the Church, as on their own innate light, and teſtimony of the Spirit within us; doth not <hi>ſo much</hi> I ſay, for I doe not deny but that the Church is a great confirmer of the truth and divinity
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:116028:91"/> of the Scriptures, and that it doth execute many good offices toward them. As</p>
            <p>Firſt, it is a witneſſe unto them, and a keeper and preſerver of them; but now will any one be ſo abſurd to ſay, that the records or writings of a King doe receive authority from their Notary or Regiſter, becauſe he keeps them?</p>
            <p>Secondly, the Church may diſcerne and judge between true and falſe ſuppoſititions Scriptures, and that by examining them according to the originall <hi>Canon</hi> and <hi>platforme of Moſes</hi> his Law, <hi>for my ſheep</hi> ſaith our Saviour <hi>John</hi> 10. <hi>heare my voyce,</hi> and ſo can diſtinguiſh it from another; but now as a Goldſmith may by his weights and touchſtone diſtinguiſh Gold from Copper, &amp; yet not be ſaid to make the Gold, yea or to make it ſo unto us, but only to make us the more eaſily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Gold it is, in like manner the <hi>Church</hi> in its examining &amp; diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Scriptures can be only ſaid to confirm unto us the divinity of them,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:116028:92"/> not in any wiſe, either in themſelves or unto us, to make them divine.</p>
            <p>The third thing that the Church doth, is to preach and divulge the Scriptures; but now as we believe and obey the Proclamation of a King, not becauſe ſuch an one proclaimeth it, but for it ſelfe, ſo likewiſe we obey and believe the Scriptures not for the Church, but its own ſake.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the Church doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound and interpret Scriptures; but now as a faithfull Interpreter of an Embaſſadour doth not either adde or take from the true ſence and meaning of him, ſo likewiſe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth or ought the true Church to adde or diminiſh any thing of Holy Writ, and therefore much leſſe hath it power to make it in any wiſe of any greater price or value then really it is in it ſelfe, and this is all the true power that the Church can challenge in relation unto the holy Scriptures: wherefore the true Church we ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in reſpect of theſe things, but we doe not adore it and make it of
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:116028:92"/> greater Authority then the Scriptures themſelves. Wherefore</p>
            <p n="3">3. We ſay, that the Authority of them doth not ſo much depend on the Church, as on their own innate light, and teſtimony of the Holy Spirit within us; their own innate light I ſay for ſaith <hi>Chamier</hi> there is in the Scriptures a <hi>peculiaris genius</hi> and ſtrein, whereby they may upon examination be eaſily diſcovered to be the Word of God, as a <hi>Critick</hi> will know by the phraſe and ſtile, and the like, that ſuch a book is <hi>Lyvies,</hi> ſuch an one <hi>Juvenalls,</hi> ſo alſo will a Chriſtian up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the due ſearch &amp; triall of the holy Scriptures by their matter Heavenly, by their ſtile deep, and by their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine phraſe myſticall, preſently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that they are the Word of God, and that they can have no other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor then the King of Heaven: and then farther I ſay there is required a Teſtimony of the holy Spirit within us, which Spirit is as I may ſo ſpeake the ſeale unto all the reſt, and peculiar only to Gods Children, a man may
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:116028:93"/> by the hearſay of the Church hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically know the Scriptures, but this will no more comfort his heart then the diſcourſes concerning honey and ſweet-meates will the ſtomacke: a man may alſo be convicted of the truth of the Word from thoſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments I preſſed even now, and yet he may be no more converted by them then the <hi>Jewes</hi> were at the <hi>Miracles</hi> of Chriſt, which they knew were wrought by a divine power: well then what is it that muſt ultimately per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade us and aſſure a child of God <hi>certitudine fidei</hi> with an aſſurance of faith that the Scriptures are the Word of God? the Church that cannot, for how can that infuſe faith, which the Scriptures every where ſet forth to be the Gift of God? what then is it that aſſures us? doubtleſſe the Spirit of God co-working with us, and upon our prayers and diligent reading and examining of the Word, aſſuring us that this Word which was thus confirmed by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, thus verifyed by the truth of
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:116028:93"/> the Propheſyes contained in it, this Word that hath ſo perfect a conſent within its ſelf, that hath ſo admirable efficacy upon the hearers and readers thereof, that hath been ſo wonderfully preſerved in all ages, that this Word, and this Word only, is the Word of God, and of divine authority; ſo then, the Church that can only report unto us, the Spirit that doth firmely perſwade us; the Church that can miniſterially only ingenerate an opinion in us, the Spirit a Faith and certainty of the Scriptures: as then men may heare a very great report of anothers worth, learning, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and yet be never fully ſatisfied concerning it, till they find it ſo to be by their own experience; or as thoſe <hi>Samaritans</hi> who did believe in part on Chriſt for the ſaying of the woman, were yet notwithſtanding further confirmed &amp; eſtabliſhed in the faith of him, when they heard his own words <hi>John</hi> 4. 24. in like manner though we may hiſtorically believe that the Scriptures are the Word of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:116028:94"/> God becauſe the Church ſaith ſo, yet this teſtimony of the Church doth miniſter little aſſurance or ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction unto a child of God, untill it be farther back't on and eſtabliſhed by a farther teſtimony of the Spirit, which undoubtedly muſt be the firmeſt aſſurance a man can have, becauſe it is <hi>that alone which doth open the eyes to behold the wondrous things of the Law, Pſal.</hi> 119. 18. <hi>'tis that alone which leadeth into all truth, Joh.</hi> 16. 13. 'tis that alone which inſeparably ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companys the faithfull in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>My Spirit which is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth ſhall not depart out of thy mouth, Iſa.</hi> 59. 21. and therefore 'tis that alone which gives ſtrongeſt evidence unto its ſelfe ſpeaking in the Scriptures, <hi>if yee receive the witneſſe of men, the witneſſe of God is greater</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Paul;</hi> the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Church is but the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of men, therefore the witneſſe of the Spirit is greater: but ſay they, the Spirit ſpeaketh by the Church, and therefore we muſt believe the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:116028:94"/> Church only when it teſtifyes of the Scriptures: <hi>Whitaker</hi> anſwers for me, that if ſo be the Spirit doth thus ſpeak by the <hi>Church,</hi> from whence then hath the Church this aſſurance but from the Spirit, and ſo our beliefe of the Scriptures muſt ultimately reſolve of neceſſity into the Teſtimony of the Spirit: againe they ſay, that the Church was before the Scriptures; we anſwer, no by no meanes, for then how can the Word be called <hi>the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting wiſedome of God, and the immortall ſeed,</hi> of which the Church is borne: the Church was before the written Word but not before the unwritten. Aske a <hi>Papiſt</hi> how they know that the Church is of ſuch authority, and they will prove it by the Scriptures, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the authority proving, muſt needs be of greater eſteem, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the authority proved: but is not the Church called the pillar and ground of truth? yes, but what doth a candle receive any light from the candleſticke, becauſe it ſtickes in it? what though the Church is the ſeat
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:116028:95"/> and manſion place of the Scriptures, yet were it poſſible that there were no Church in the World, yet is not the Scripture of leſſe authority then now it is; the Church then is only a <hi>miniſteriall</hi> pillar to preſerve, keep, and ſet forth the word, <hi>not a fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall</hi> one to uphold and give being unto it: and here I might wade far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into a Diſcourſe concerning the authority of the Church and the Scriptures, but it having been ſo fully handled already and anſwered by multitudes of eminent men, I ſhall goe no farther: it remaines that I ſhould practically apply what hath been already ſpoken, but this, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the other propertyes of Scriptures, their perſpicuity and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, I ſhall leave to the next part.</p>

<pb n="200" facs="tcp:116028:98"/> pleaſe, that the knowledge of Chriſt is the moſt excellent knowledge that is. I might proſecute all theſe, but I ſhall pitch only on the latter, as being moſt ſuitable to the place and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany I ſpeake to. In proſecution of the point, I ſhall ſhew unto you <hi>firſt,</hi> what is meant by the knowledge of Chriſt. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall ſhew unto you what qualifications there be in this knowledge, that may denominate it ſo excellent. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I ſhall more particularly ſhew unto you, whence it is that this knowledge is ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> apply the point.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What is meant by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt Jeſus our Lord: there is a twofold knowledge of things; firſt, a bare Hiſtoricall and ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative, the ſecond a practicall experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall knowledge; The firſt is only a ſuperficiall view, and glance of the underſtanding upon the truth and being of things; thus the Divels do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, &amp; thus even <hi>reprobates</hi> may know Chriſt; As a man may know a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in a Map or table, which yet he is
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:116028:98"/> never like to ſee; ſo may the moſt debauch't wicked wretch in the world have ſome ſcantling book-knowledge of Chriſt, and yet never enjoy him in Heaven hereafter; he may be able to draw a ſcholaſtick Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſicall ſcheme of Chriſt his natures, his offices, his ſtates of humility, exaltation, and the like; he may be able to diſcourſe profoundly of his Incarnation, the Hypoſtaticall union, and whole myſtery of our redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and yet with all his learning ſinke deeper into Hell: though his braine may be full of notionall truths, yet his heart may be empty of any comfortable experiences of his Lord and Saviour, He cannot with <hi>Thomas</hi> ſay, <hi>my Lord and my God;</hi> but as the <hi>Grecks,</hi> that came up to worſhip at the feaſt <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. would faine ſee Jeſus, yet more out of curioſity, then deſire to be inſtructed by him; ſo doe ſuch ſeek after and ſtudy Chriſt more in order to the ſatisfaction of their underſtandings, then converſion of their ſoules. But</p>
            <pb n="202" facs="tcp:116028:99"/>
            <p> 2. There is a practicall experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall knowledge, where the truths that we know have a ſtrong impreſſion upon our ſoules, ſo as to worke and transforme them into the ſame image with the thing known; when we do not reſt in the bare contemplation of the thing, but perfectly love and are raviſh't with the excellencyes of it: and this is that knowledge of Chriſt that <hi>Paul</hi> prefers in the text, he counts all things as loſſe and dung in compariſon of it, the more he knew Chriſt, the leſſe he regarded other things; the more he was taken with him, the more willing was he to be ruled by him as his Lord, to obey his precepts, to be anſwerable to him in all things; now this practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call knowledge of Chriſt includes therefore theſe three things as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Aſſent to his Doctrine, Word, and Promiſes. Every ſcience before it is perfectly gotten ſuppoſeth an aſſent to ſome undemonſtrable principles, which are foundations of it; thus,

'tis ſaid, <hi>that his Sheepe heare his voice and follow him;</hi> they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently adhere to his word, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly obey him in it, <hi>He that heareth my Word, and believeth on him that ſent me, hath everlaſting Life, Joh.</hi> 5. 24. we muſt firſt hearken to his Word before we can believe on him, and have everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> it implyes affection to Chriſt. For as Gods knowing his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple implyes his love towards them in Scripture, <hi>the Lord knows the way of the Righteous, Pſal.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 6. ſo his peoples knowing of God implyes alſo affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction towards him; hence Chriſt ſaith <hi>that he knows his ſheep, and is known of them, John</hi> 10. 14. which implyes on both ſides a mutuall love to each other: for ſo expreſsly <hi>v.</hi> 15. he ſaith <hi>he will lay down his life for his ſheep.</hi> Hence ignorance is every where in holy writ made the ground of mens
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:116028:100"/> hatred and diſaffection to Chriſt, and his people; <hi>had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 8. and <hi>John</hi> 15. 21. and <hi>c.</hi> 16. <hi>v.</hi> 3. <hi>All theſe things</hi> (meaning <hi>perſecutions)</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>they will doe unto you, becauſe they have not known the Father nor me:</hi> did a man throughly and ſavingly know Chriſt he would be more in love with him; for there is ſuch an intimacy and union between the truth and goodneſſe of divine ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, that whoſoever rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands the one will preſently imbrace the other; ſo that be ſure, that is but a vaine empty knowledge of Chriſt, where the characters of it are not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in our hearts and affections; even in common diſcourſe, when we ſay I know ſuch a one is of excellent parts, of a ſweet and good diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; this implies our ſecret eſteem and reſpect unto the perſon; and how can we be ſaid truely to know him as <hi>the faireſt of ten-thouſand,</hi> as our Saviour, Reconciler, Lord and God? unleſſe our hearts be carryed
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:116028:101"/> forth in a high eſteem and love of him: 'tis ſaid <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 19. <hi>The Divells do believe and therefore tremble;</hi> certainly did they know there was any mercy in ſtore for them (as now there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but vengeance) as they now tremble and feare, ſo they would then love and admire Chriſt; and did we but juſtly underſtand the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble goodneſſe and excellencies of Chriſt, we ſhould be more taken with him, we ſhould keep his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with more obſervance, and feare more to diſpleaſe him then we doe. O let us never ſay we know Chriſt, that we have intimacy and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with him, when our hearts are farre from him; when we have an <hi>Idea</hi> of him in our Braine, and not ſo much as a luſt Crucified by the Knowledge of his death, not one grace the more implanted by the knowledge of his Reſurrection; when we pretend to know him, yet grieve his Spirit, wound his glory, trample under foot his blood, diſobey his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, and preferre a <hi>Barrabas,</hi> a robber,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:116028:101"/> a ſinne that diſpoiles him of his Glory before the Lord of life; believe it, this knowledge of Chriſt is <hi>ſcientia affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va;</hi> it muſt ſinke deeper then ſo into our affections, and transforme the whole man into the image of Chriſt, otherwiſe it is but a counterfeit, not a reall knowledge of him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> this practicall knowledg of Chriſt implies a particuliar applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him to our own ſoules; what good will it doe me to know there is gold in the <hi>Indies,</hi> unleſſe I had it in my coffer, or to know when I am hungry that there is in ſuch a place hony and food, unleſſe I did taſt it my ſelfe? no more good will the knowledge of Chriſt doe us, unleſſe we doe eate him and drinke him by faith, and can ſay with <hi>Paul</hi> in the text, <hi>I know him to be my Lord that hath redeemed me and will ſave me:</hi> you will not count him a good <hi>Phyſitian</hi> that knoweth only the name, figure, and ſhape of an hearb in <hi>Gerhard</hi> or <hi>Mathio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> and not the uſe and application of the ſame, and ſo neither can ye
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:116028:102"/> call him a knowing Chriſtian that can diſcourſe only of Chriſt in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, being in the meane while igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the benefits and the comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table application of them: he may ſtill for all this lay under the curſe, under the pangs of conſcience, the ſence of the wrath of God, the tyranny of ſin and Sathan, unleſſe he can feele Chriſts ſpirit, as <hi>Thomas</hi> did corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and ſay, <hi>My Lord and My God, Joh.</hi> 20. 28. in all true knowledge the Acts of the underſtanding are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexive, the ſoule will ſtart back and rebound upon its ſelfe, it will firſt goe out unto Chriſt its direct object, and then turne in upon its ſelfe, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine its own intereſt in him. Hence ſaith Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>Examine your ſelves whether you be in the Faith,</hi> let your ſoules retire into them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and there diligently examine the matter, and you will quickly find whether you believe in Chriſt or have any communion with him, which cannot be rightly known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe you ſo examine your ſelves, and
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:116028:102"/> ſo much ſhall ſuffice to be ſpoken of the firſt point.</p>
            <p>The ſecond is the <hi>qualifications</hi> of this knowledge.</p>
            <p n="1">1. 'Tis a revealed ſupernaturall knowledge. <hi>Fleſh and blood hath not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed it unto thee,</hi> ſaith Chriſt of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to <hi>Simon Peter, but my Father which is in Heaven, Mat.</hi> 16. <hi>v.</hi> 17. nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther carnall reaſon nor humane wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome can ever ſuggeſt Chriſt unto us: 'tis God alone that reveales his Sonne in us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 16. Nature can riſe no higher then things within its own bounds and ſpheare: As water cannot runne above its own fountaine: now the knowledg of Chriſt doth much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the reach of <hi>naturall</hi> diſquiſition, 'tis <hi>the wiſedome of God in a myſtery, hidden wiſedome, which none of the princes of this world knew,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. we attaine uſually unto <hi>naturall</hi> knowledg by much indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry &amp; turmoile of <hi>body</hi> &amp; <hi>minde,</hi> when our underſtanding doth out of ſome imperfect hintes, and bluſhes of the cauſes of things, by degrees hack and hew out the truth of them, and by
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:116028:103"/> much labour and toyle we get and ſerve out of nature the ſmall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that we have; whereas now all the toyle and ſtudy in the world will never advance a meer naturall man to the knowledge of Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I ſuppoſe he hath not ſo much as a hint from nature to ſet him a worke in the purſuit of it: that there ſhould be three perſons in the Eſſence, that the ſecond of theſe perſons, God the Sonne, ſhould be made man, and be degraded to the forme of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, be borne of a virgin, dye, and in death get a victory over death, and the like, are ſuch riddles to a naturall man, that he cannot poſſibly receive them, as the Apoſtle expreſſeth it 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 15. neither can he in his moſt extravagant and roving apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons faſten or light upon them: which makes me thinke that <hi>Triſmegiſtus</hi> and <hi>Plato</hi> had been peeping into the books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> when they ſpeak ſo emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally of the <gap reason="foreign">

               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:116028:103"/> 
               <hi>veritate Religionis,</hi> ſo that the meer hiſtoriall knowledge of Chriſt doth originally ariſe from revelation, how much more then doth the true ſaving knowledge of him deſcend immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from the Spirit of God, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning our underſtandings to ſee him, opening our hearts to embrace him, and guiding us into all truth, 'tis not our poring upon a body of Divinity, our running over the Schoolemen, and ſpending our oyle and labour in the bare ſpeculation of theſe truths, that bring us to a ſaving knowledge of Chriſt; but we muſt be all taught of God, and waite upon the bleſſed influences of his Spirit with an humble ſoule, with prayers and teares, and faſting and weeping and mourning for our ignorance, that God would come from above into us and inſtruct us in the excellent know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him, who indeed <hi>to them that periſh is fooliſhneſſe, but to them that are called the wiſedome of God, and the power of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 This is the alone ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:116028:104"/> that is, <hi>this is life eternall that they might know thee the only true God and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent, Ioh.</hi> 17. 3. <hi>There is no other name given under Heaven by whom we can be ſaved; and he is the way, the truth, and the life, and the door</hi> by whom alone we have entrance into Heaven, how can we enter into life, but by the way, by the doore? how can we ſee the Father but by the Sonne, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veales him? So that to aſſigne Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſuch as never ſo much as dream't of Chriſt, is a preſumption not juſtifiable by Scripture or reaſon: I cannot conceive how the dimme ſnuffe of naturall light ſhould be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to guide a man to Heaven. 'Tis only that light of the world, as the Evangeliſt ſaith, that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that Sunne of the ſoule (as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtiles him) that ſhewes us the way to eternall happineſſe, ſince without faith in him 'tis impoſſible to pleaſe God, and all the beſt righteouſneſſes of naturall men are but menſtruous raggs, ſplendid abominations; A corrupt tree cannot bring forth good
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:116028:104"/> fruit, neither doe we gather grapes of thornes; we may in charity hope, we cannot out of the Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that any are ſaved without the knowledge of Chriſt: neither the <hi>Jewes</hi> ſimply by their Law, nor the <hi>Gentiles</hi> by their <hi>Phyloſophy</hi> could ever reach Heaven. Though <hi>Clemens Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andrinus,</hi> and many of the Schoolmen, &amp; <hi>Zuinglius</hi> ſeem to teach the contrary, perhaps more out of charity to ſoe many poore ſoules, that otherwiſe they thought muſt inevitably periſh, then any ſolid grounds they had from Scripture for it: and ſeriouſly who could without trembling think of the ſad condition of thoſe poor wretches that the revealed Word of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes them under, were it not for this, that God ha's unſearcheable wayes to ſave thoſe that we moſt deſpair of, that the inſinite mercifull creator can by meanes altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to us, diſplay his Sonne even to thoſe that <hi>ſit in darkeneſſe,</hi> and the <hi>regions of death.</hi> But to haſten.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This knowledge of Chriſt is a
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:116028:105"/> pleaſant knowledge: All knowledge (as the <hi>Phyloſopher</hi> notes) carries a ſecret content and pleaſure along with it, and therefore <hi>videre &amp; ſpeculari quaerimus ut gaudeamus;</hi> As delightfull colours are unto the eye, ſo is truth unto the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, a comfortable refreſhing thing; now the knowledge of Chriſt muſt be pleaſant in its very firſt dawning to a benighted ſoule, for the entrance of it <hi>giveth light and underſtanding to the ſimple, Pſ</hi> 119. <hi>v.</hi> 130. muſt not the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of light be needs be pleaſant to thoſe under the poles after halfe a years darkneſſe, or unto ſuch as are borne blind, or have been kept in a dungeon all their dayes before; and can the Sun of Righteouſneſſe think ye be otherwiſe when he riſeth in a poore ſoule, that hath laid thirty, forty, perhaps fifty yeares togeither in blindneſſe and ignorance? O how comfortable a thing will it then be unto him to ſee himſelfe <hi>tranſlated out of darkeneſſe into marvellous light,</hi> to find the eyes of his underſtanding opened,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:116028:105"/> the veile taken off, and his ſinnes par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, which were as a thick cloud to hinder him from the ſight of his Saviour, <hi>all the wayes of wiſedome are wayes of pleaſantneſſe and her paths peace, Prov.</hi> 3. 17. What more pleaſant then light? why <hi>Chriſt is the true light: Joh.</hi> 1. what more delightſome to the taſt then hony? <hi>His statutes are ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the hony or hony-combe, Pſal.</hi> 19. what more taketh us then eaſe and reſt? <hi>his very yoake is eaſie and his burden light, Mat.</hi> 11. 'tis ignorance of Chriſt that makes his wayes ſeem unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to us; for no man ever tooke any pleaſure in that which he underſtands not; hence thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward loathings of his Word, thoſe riſings and heart-burnings againſt the ſimplicity of the Goſpell in prophane perſons; theſe are people of no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, they never knew what belonged to the inward comforts and refreſhments of the Spirit; what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light there is in keeping Gods Law, what pleaſure 'tis for a thirſty ſoule to drink of the water of life, for a
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:116028:106"/> hungry ſoule to feed upon Manna and the bread that came down from Heaven? they know what comfort there is in the kiſſes of his mouth, in his love that is better then wine, in his abode and ſupping with you; and therefore no wonder that all their delight is to dowze themſelves in carnall pleaſures, to <hi>eate and drinke and riſe up to play,</hi> that they are ſo averſe from dutyes, ſo ſad and heavy in ſpirituall performances, that they ſo much loath his Word, his people, his Embaſſadours, his gracious motions, and invitations, the truth of all is this, they know not Chriſt, and therefore they have no pleaſure in him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This knowledge is a ſatisfying knowledge: other knowledge is like ſome ſance, which when you receive into you, begets a freſh and new ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite; the knowledge of the one thing doth ſet the teeth on edge, as here, and makes us thirſt after more, whereas Chriſt is an object fitted and ſuited to the moſt vaſt and bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:116028:106"/> deſires of the ſoule, and therefore what the <hi>Phyloſpher</hi> ſaid of naturall knowledge, we may more properly ſay of divine, that 'tis <gap reason="foreign">

There is enough in him to fill the ſoul up to the brim, and to anſwer all the impatient rovings and agitations of our Spirits after know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; in him dwelleth all fullneſſe, fulneſſe of Grace to ſanctify us, full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of righteouſneſſe to juſtify us, fullneſſe of Glory to crown us: no na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall object can ſatisfy the ſoule, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the deſires there of being bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, &amp; infinite, it preſently digeſts &amp; ſwallowes up all finite things, but now Chriſt both in his nature and Graces is ſo commenſurate and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable an object for the ſoule, that it may eternally feed upon him to full content and ſatisfaction; His mercies infinite, his love infinite, his
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:116028:107"/> Graces are inexhauſtible, for God hath not given the Spirit by meaſure, and his gifts and graces are compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the <hi>Prophet</hi> to a <hi>feaeſt of marrow and fat things, Iſ.</hi> 25, <hi>v.</hi> 6. becauſe as theſe do ſatisfie the ſenſuall, ſo thoſe the intellectuall appetite, <hi>it ſatisfieth the longing ſoule and filleth the hungry ſoule with goodneſſe, Pſal.</hi> 107. <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>wherefore then ſaith the Prophet Eſay</hi> 55. <hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>doe yee ſpend money for that which is not bread, and your labour for that which ſatufyeth not, Hearken diligently unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your ſoule delight it ſelfe in fatneſſe.</hi>

O beloved! we are to deale with the ſoules of
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:116028:112"/> men; to reſcue them from Hell, and to pluck them out of the paws of the Divell, by whom they are led captive. We meet againe too too often with poor ignorant wretches to inſtruct, who ſcarce know whether there be any Chriſt, any Holy Ghoſt; more-over we are not to deale with fleſh and blood, but with principalityes and powers; the luſts of men they are to be blaſted and beaten down by us; the conſciences of men to be wrought upon and ſatisfied, ſins to be convicted the <hi>righteouſneſſe of Chriſt</hi> to be preſſed; <hi>the Croſſe of Chriſt which is fooliſhneſſe to the world to be preached;</hi> this is our labour, this our worke, &amp; what need we then to daube with untempered morter, and to mixe humane inventions with ſacred truths: why is that zealous thirſt after applauſe, and to ſet up our ſelves more then our Saviour? why is it then men deſire oftentimes more to diſplay their own reading then the knowledge of Chriſt and him cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed? not as if there were no uſe of humane learning in the myſtery of
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:116028:112"/> the Word, <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe made uſe of a Poet to convince the <hi>Athenians, Act.</hi> 17. nor doe we ſpeake this to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance thoſe that doe the worke of the Lord <hi>negligently,</hi> and bring the lame, ſapleſſe, undigeſted notions, to this ſacrifice: doubtleſſe God that requires the whole man, requires the braine as well as the heart in this ſervice, and he gives us talents not to lay up in a napkin, but to bring themforth as occaſion ſhall require for his Glory and the Churches good; we all know by ſad experience, into what diſorders and inconveniences, the contempt of ſecular learning hath brought many giddy ſoules of this Nation, and how proſtituted and diſregarded the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe management, and wanton itch of preaching hath made the office of the miniſtry. O that God would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to convince all of us, eſpecially the forward youth of this Univerſity, of the tremendous burthen that lyes upon the ſhoulders of a Miniſter, <hi>Opus Angelis formidandum,</hi> but to return: I ſay we do not hereby <hi>diſcountenance</hi> lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,

            <p n="2">2.

<pb n="231" facs="tcp:116028:113"/> aske theſe great Maſters of <hi>Iſrael</hi> why the myſteries of the Goſpell, and the knowledge of Chriſt ſhould be ſo much ſlighted by them? is it becauſe 'tis fooliſhneſſe unto them, why let them know, that the <hi>fooliſhneſſe of God is wiſer then men;</hi> and all the empty ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternes of worldly wiſedome, are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing comparable to thoſe treaſures of wiſedome and knowledge, that are hid in Chriſt: or is it becauſe there is more reputation that attends worldly knowledg? why alas! <hi>what credit is it to be accounted wiſe amongſt a company of fooles?</hi> and ſuch the Scriptures every where terme the world and carnall men; the World indeed viliſies and hates Chriſt, becauſe it knowes him not, but then Chriſt profeſſeth he will not know them at the laſt day, and O then <hi>what will become of the wiſe, the Scribe, the diſputer of this world?</hi> will it not then appeare that the wiſedome of this world was fooliſhneſſe; and that they bought the eſteeme of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at a deere rate, when they ſhall ſee indeed, that <hi>not many wiſe</hi>
               <pb n="232" facs="tcp:116028:114"/> men <hi>after the fleſh</hi> are ſaved; or laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is it becauſe they find more content in worldly wiſedome? why let the wiſe man ſpeake what content there can be therein <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>in much wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome there is much griefe, and he that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth knowledge, increaſeth ſorrow:</hi> how much toile and vexation in getting it, how much care for feare of looſing it, yea how little comfort in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of it? ſo many luſts ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſing and clouding their ſevereſt meditations, ſo much thoughtfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to uphold their eſteem in the world, ſo much envy at others emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, ſo much diſtraction by occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of new doubts and difficulties &amp;c. whereas now the true ſaving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt brings a ſerenity and compoſedneſſe of mind with it, purgeth and reſineth the ſoule from thoſe darke miſts of corruption, ſanctifyes and ſweetens all other lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and exerciſeth all other parts which are but loſſe and dung with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; and why then ſhould this ſo excellent knowledge be thought ſo

Gallus</hi> gnaw upon flintes and pebbles amidſt ſweet-meates and moſt delicate fare? why ſhould men be ſo greedy after the jejune and empty knowledge of the creatures, and yet ſo remiſſe in the purſuit of Heavenly wiſedome? O that we could all underſtand <hi>that the feare of the Lord is the beginning of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and the greateſt glory of our wiſedome to be wiſe unto Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Therefore this ſhould exhort us all to ſtudy Jeſus Chriſt; and to labour after the knowledge of him, <hi>whom only to know is eternall life:</hi> all knowledge is in it ſelfe deſirable; it being the beſt gloſſe and varniſh that ſets forth an intellectuall being; and hence ſaith <hi>Lactantius,</hi> God hath lim'd and armed mans inſide with reaſon that he might diſtinguiſh him from all the creatures of lower formes; ſo that he ſeems leſſer then a man,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:116028:115"/> that is not taken even with naturall truth &amp; wiſedome; and certainly he is leſſe then a Chriſtian, that deſires not Heavenly and Spirituall wiſedome: 'tis naturall for all things to deſire their perfection; now then as the knowledge of naturall things is the perfection of a man, ſo the knowledg of Chriſt is the perfection of a Chriſtian, and therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> bids us ſeeke after it more <hi>then choyce gold, Prov.</hi> 8, <hi>v.</hi> 10. we all deſire wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, why <hi>in him are hid all the treaſures of wiſedome,</hi> and therefore enough to fill up all the vaſt and boundleſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of our immortall ſoules; <hi>'tis only fooles that deſpiſe wiſedome, Prov.</hi> 1. as therefore you deſire not to be branded with the name of fooles, go unto Chriſt, who is the wiſedome of God, <hi>the authour of of every good and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect gift,</hi> and if any of you lack this wiſedome <hi>let him aske of God, that giveth unto all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it ſhall be given him, Jam.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 5.</p>
            <p>So that the 1. direction for the attaining of this knowledge of Chriſt
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:116028:115"/> may be the prayer of faith, <hi>let him aske in faith nothing wavering,</hi> pray unto God that he would ſhew thee thy naturall blindneſſe, ignorance, and ſtupidity; what a foole thou art by nature; how deſtitute of any ſaving knowledge; and that then he would ſend his Spirit into thy inward parts, to enlighten thy mind and to bring thee out of darkneſſe into mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous light; pray unto him that Chriſt may be made unto thee wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that thou mayſt know him here in his Perſon, in his Offices, in his benefits, know him in the pardon of thy ſinnes, in the ſubduing of thy corruptions; as thy King that will ſave thee, thy Prieſt that hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed thee, thy Prophet that doth inſtruct thee.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Labour to ſee the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and miſeries that will follow upon thy not knowing of Chriſt; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we can know nothing beſides him that can miniſter any comfort unto us; in Heaven above what is to be known there? but an angry ſinne
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:116028:116"/> revenging God, an implacable judge, whom no man hath ſeen, nor ever ſhall ſee in the way of mercy, unleſſe the Sonne reveale him unto him: in the earth, what objects can we fixe upon that are not our mortall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes without Chriſt? all the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures they are ready to ſnap at us, and revenge the quarell of God againſt ſinne upon us: in Hell what can we know but that 'tis our place, that 'tis prepared alone for thoſe that know not God? for ſo ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> that <hi>Chriſt at the laſt day ſhall be revealed from Heaven, with his mighty Angells, in fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fire to take vengeance on thoſe that know not God,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſs.</hi> 1. 8. againe, labour to ſee what inconveniences the want of the ſaving knowledge of Chriſt will bring us unto; a man that walkes in the darke will be ever apt to ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and fall, and ſo 'tis here, he that is without any Spirituall light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, muſt needs walke in much danger; thus <hi>the Goſpell was to the Jewes a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling blocke,</hi> becauſe they were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of its excellencies; and thus the
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:116028:116"/> ordinances of Chriſt are ſtumbling blockes to them that know him not, they hate them, the people of Chriſt are deſpiſed, <hi>they having no knowledge eate them up as they would eate bread, Pſal.</hi> 14. 4. did men but throughly know Chriſt, they would be more in love with his ordinances, with his people, with his Miniſters, with Salvation, with their own ſoules: labour then to ſee theſe inconveniences of ſpirituall ignorance, be aſhamed of thy ſelfe, and lay about thee with all thy might for to gaine more knowledge. To this end,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Study Chriſts bookes, the Holy Scripture, and thou ſhalt by the grace of God come to a knowledge of him: theſe alone are able to make thee <hi>perfect and wiſe unto Salvation;</hi> they are thoſe wells out of which we may draw plenty of the waters of Salvation; thoſe precious mines out of which we may digge treaſures of wiſedome; let us ſearch them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not with a ſearch of curioſity, to diſcourſe and talke of them, but
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:116028:117"/> with a ſearch of humility to amend our lives by them, and to furniſh our ſelves with the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt; other bookes can only unfold nature unto thee, and that but imperfectly too: this reveales myſteries <hi>that Angells them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves did deſire to peepe into:</hi> ſo that there is more reall worth compriſed in one verſicle of them, then there is in all the voluminous Offsprings and workes of mans braine; as the very ſhavings and filings of gold and precious ſtones are of more value then whole heaps of dirt and pebbles.</p>
            <p>To conclude therefore, ſince we have ſo excellent a knowledge before us, <hi>more to be deſired then Gold, yea then much fine gold, more precious then Rubies,</hi> ſince we have ſuch plentifull mines before us, as the Scriptures, out of which we may dig theſe treaſures, what remaines but that we ſtill labour <hi>to grow in grace and in the knowledg of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and continually to ſtudy him on earth, whom we all hope to enjoy in Heaven: as travellers will
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:116028:117"/> learne the manners and cuſtomes of the people and country they are to go unto; ſo let us ſtudy Heaven and Chriſt in his Word, that ſo we may comfortably poſſeſſe him at the end of our pilgrimage in Heaven hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. We know not how ſoone Chriſt may ſummon us before him, and that day come, <hi>when our ſelves and all our naturall knowledge muſt be wrapt up in the ſame ſheet together;</hi> the ſhortneſſe and uncertainty of our dayes beſpeakes our double diligence, and no longer to play the truants in the Schoole of Chriſt, but to redeem the time we have loſt, and to improve the few dayes we have before us towards the advancement of this knowledge: let us ſtudy Chriſt, let us preach Chriſt, let us live to Chriſt, that ſo theſe <hi>ſeed plots of learning</hi> may not be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>ſeminaries of Atheiſme</hi> and hereſy, as the Schooles of the <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi> were in primitive times, but the Seminaries of the knowledg of Chriſt: farre be it that in theſe our Chriſtian <hi>Athens</hi> there ſhould be an <hi>unknown</hi>
               <pb n="240" facs="tcp:116028:118"/> 
               <hi>God,</hi> an <hi>unknown Chriſt;</hi> great are our meanes, our advantages, and oportunities in the attaining of this knowledge, and great therefore and ſadde will be our accounts at the laſt day, if we neglect it: As therefore we tender the good of ourſoules, as ever we expect the fruition of Chriſt in glory, let it be our conſtant care to ſtudy him here, &amp; to contemplate him in the glaſſes of his word and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, till at length this our imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect knowledge of him be ſwallowed up in viſion, and a comfortable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of him, <hi>with whom is fullneſſe of joy and pleaſures for evermore.</hi>
